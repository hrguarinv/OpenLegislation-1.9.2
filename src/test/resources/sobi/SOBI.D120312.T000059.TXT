2011S06257CT03643    5    (i-a)(A) Where charges of incompetence are brought based solely upon a
2011S06257CT03644    6  pattern of ineffective teaching or performance of a classroom teacher or
2011S06257CT03645    7  principal,  as  defined in section three thousand twelve-c of this arti-
2011S06257CT03646    8  cle, the hearing shall be conducted before and by a single hearing offi-
2011S06257CT03647    9  cer in an expedited hearing, which  shall  commence  within  seven  days
2011S06257CT03648   10  after  the  pre-hearing  conference  and shall be completed within sixty
2011S06257CT03649   11  days after the pre-hearing conference. The hearing officer shall  estab-
2011S06257CT03650   12  lish a hearing schedule at the pre-hearing conference to ensure that the
2011S06257CT03651   13  expedited  hearing  is  completed  within the required timeframes and to
2011S06257CT03652   14  ensure an equitable distribution of days between the employing board and
2011S06257CT03653   15  the charged employee. Notwithstanding any other law, rule or  regulation
2011S06257CT03654   16  to  the  contrary,  no adjournments may be granted that would extend the
2011S06257CT03655   17  hearing beyond such sixty days, except as authorized  in  this  subpara-
2011S06257CT03656   18  graph.  A  hearing  officer,  upon request, may grant a limited and time
2011S06257CT03657   19  specific adjournment that would extend the  hearing  beyond  such  sixty
2011S06257CT03658   20  days if the hearing officer determines that the delay is attributable to
2011S06257CT03659   21  a  circumstance  or  occurrence  substantially beyond the control of the
2011S06257CT03660   22  requesting party and an injustice would result if the  adjournment  were
2011S06257CT03661   23  not granted.
2011S06257CT03662   24    (B)  Such  charges shall allege that the employing board has developed
2011S06257CT03663   25  and substantially implemented a teacher or principal improvement plan in

2011S06257CT03664   26  accordance with subdivision four of section three thousand  twelve-c  of
2011S06257CT03665   27  this  article  for  the employee following the first evaluation in which
2011S06257CT03666   28  the employee was rated ineffective, and the immediately preceding evalu-
2011S06257CT03667   29  ation if the employee was rated developing.  Notwithstanding  any  other
2011S06257CT03668   30  provision  of  law to the contrary, a pattern of ineffective teaching or
2011S06257CT03669   31  performance as defined in section three thousand twelve-c of this  arti-
2011S06257CT03670   32  cle  shall  constitute  very  significant  evidence  of incompetence for
2011S06257CT03671   33  purposes  of  this  section.  Nothing  in  this  subparagraph  shall  be
2011S06257CT03672   34  construed  to limit the defenses which the employee may place before the
2011S06257CT03673   35  hearing officer in challenging the allegation of a pattern  of  ineffec-
2011S06257CT03674   36  tive teaching or performance.
2011S06257CT03675   37    (C)  The  commissioner  shall annually inform all hearing officers who
2011S06257CT03676   38  have heard cases pursuant to this section during the preceding year that
2011S06257CT03677   39  the time periods prescribed in this subparagraph  for  conducting  expe-
2011S06257CT03678   40  dited  hearings are to be strictly followed. A record of continued fail-
2011S06257CT03679   41  ure to commence and complete expedited hearings within the time  periods
2011S06257CT03680   42  prescribed  in  this  subparagraph  shall  be considered grounds for the
2011S06257CT03681   43  commissioner to exclude such individual from the list of potential hear-
2011S06257CT03682   44  ing officers sent to the employing board and the employee for such expe-
2011S06257CT03683   45  dited hearings.
2011S06257CT03684   46    (ii) The hearing officer selected to  conduct  a  hearing  under  this
2011S06257CT03685   47  section shall, within ten to fifteen days of agreeing to serve [as such]
2011S06257CT03686   48  IN  SUCH  POSITION, hold a pre-hearing conference which shall be held in
2011S06257CT03687   49  the school district or county seat of the county, or any county, wherein
2011S06257CT03688   50  the employing school board is located. The pre-hearing conference  shall
2011S06257CT03689   51  be  limited in length to one day except that the hearing officer, in his
2011S06257CT03690   52  or her discretion, may allow one additional day for good cause shown.
2011S06257CT03691   53    (iii) At the pre-hearing conference the hearing officer shall have the
2011S06257CT03692   54  power to:
2011S06257CT03693   55    (A) issue subpoenas;

2011S06257CT03701    5  limited  to, any witness statement (or statements), investigatory state-
2011S06257CT03702    6  ment (or statements) or note (notes), exculpatory evidence or any  other
2011S06257CT03703    7  evidence,  including  district or student records, relevant and material
2011S06257CT03704    8  to the employee's defense.
2011S06257CT03705    9    (iv) Any pre-hearing motion or application relative to the sufficiency
2011S06257CT03706   10  of the charges, application or amendment  thereof,  or  any  preliminary
2011S06257CT03707   11  matters shall be made upon written notice to the hearing officer and the
2011S06257CT03708   12  adverse  party no less than five days prior to the date of the pre-hear-
2011S06257CT03709   13  ing conference. Any pre-hearing motions  or  applications  not  made  as
2011S06257CT03710   14  provided  for  herein  shall  be  deemed waived except for good cause as
2011S06257CT03711   15  determined by the hearing officer.
2011S06257CT03712   16    (v) In the event that at  the  pre-hearing  conference  the  employing
2011S06257CT03713   17  board  presents  evidence  that the professional license of the employee
2011S06257CT03714   18  has been revoked and all judicial and administrative remedies have  been
2011S06257CT03715   19  exhausted  or  foreclosed,  the hearing officer shall schedule the date,
2011S06257CT03716   20  time and place for an expedited hearing, which  hearing  shall  commence
2011S06257CT03717   21  not  more  than  seven  days  after the pre-hearing conference and which
2011S06257CT03718   22  shall be limited to one day. The expedited hearing shall be held in  the
2011S06257CT03719   23  local school district or county seat of the county or any county, where-
2011S06257CT03720   24  in  the said employing board is located. The expedited hearing shall not
2011S06257CT03721   25  be postponed except upon the request of a party and then only  for  good
2011S06257CT03722   26  cause  as determined by the hearing officer. At such hearing, each party
2011S06257CT03723   27  shall have equal time in which to present its case.
2011S06257CT03724   28    (vi) During the pre-hearing  conference,  the  hearing  officer  shall
2011S06257CT03725   29  determine the reasonable amount of time necessary for a final hearing on
2011S06257CT03726   30  the  charge  or  charges  and  shall  schedule the location, time(s) and

2011S06257CT03729   33  ein  the  said  employing school board is located. In the event that the
2011S06257CT03730   34  hearing officer determines that the nature  of  the  case  requires  the
2011S06257CT03731   35  final hearing to last more than one day, the days that are scheduled for
2011S06257CT03732   36  the  final  hearing  shall be consecutive. The day or days scheduled for
2011S06257CT03733   37  the final hearing shall not be postponed except upon the  request  of  a
2011S06257CT03734   38  party  and  then  only for good cause shown as determined by the hearing
2011S06257CT03735   39  officer. In all cases, the final hearing shall  be  completed  no  later
2011S06257CT03736   40  than  sixty  days  after  the  pre-hearing conference unless the hearing
2011S06257CT03737   41  officer determines that extraordinary circumstances  warrant  a  limited
2011S06257CT03738   42  extension.

2011S06257CT03763    8  action, if any, shall be taken by the employing board. At the request of
2011S06257CT03764    9  the employee, in determining what, if any, penalty or other action shall
2011S06257CT03765   10  be imposed, the hearing officer shall consider the extent to  which  the
2011S06257CT03766   11  employing  board  made  efforts  towards  correcting the behavior of the
2011S06257CT03767   12  employee which resulted in charges  being  brought  under  this  section
2011S06257CT03768   13  through  means  including  but  not limited to: remediation, peer inter-

2011S06257CT03778   23    [(b)] B. Within fifteen days of receipt of the hearing officer's deci-
2011S06257CT03779   24  sion the employing board shall implement the decision. If  the  employee
2011S06257CT03780   25  is  acquitted  he  or  she shall be restored to his or her position with

2011S06257CT03788   33    [(c)]  C.  The  hearing officer shall indicate in the decision whether
2011S06257CT03789   34  any of the charges brought by the  employing  board  were  frivolous  as
2011S06257CT03790   35  defined  in  section [eight thousand three] EIGHTY-THREE hundred three-a

2011S06257CT04181   14  sight of the system are maintained;

2011S06257CT04187   20  family and community supports are actively engaged;
2011S06257CT04188   21    e) be based on evidence-informed practices, ensuring that programs and
2011S06257CT04189   22  services provided are shown to have worked  in  improving  outcomes  for
2011S06257CT04190   23  youth,  maintaining  public  safety and reducing unnecessary confinement
2011S06257CT04191   24  and recidivism and unwarranted racial/ethnic disparities; and
2011S06257CT04192   25    f) provide  effective  reintegration  services,  ensuring  that  youth
2011S06257CT04193   26  remain connected to appropriate educational services and positive behav-
2011S06257CT04194   27  ioral  supports and/or treatment modalities upon transitioning home from
