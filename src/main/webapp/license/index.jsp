		In order to make the Senate's information and software as public as possible, it is has adopted unique system using two types of licenses  - GNU General Public License as well as the BSD License. This system is meant to ensure the most public license is used in each specific case such that:
		<br/>
		<br/>
		(i) Any Software released containing components with preexisting GPL copyrights must be released pursuant to a GPL v3 copyright restriction.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		(ii) Any Software created independently by the Senate without any preexisting licensing restrictions on any of its components shall be released under dual licensing and take one of two forms: (a) a BSD license, or (b) a GPL v3 license.  The ultimate user of such Software shall choose which form of licensing makes the most sense for his or her project.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		(iii) Regarding Software containing preexisting copyright restrictions other than GPL, the CIO shall make the determination how he or she wishes to release such Software.
