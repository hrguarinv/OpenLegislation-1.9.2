OpenLegislation
====================

`From the New York State Senate`

Dual BSD/GPL License. See the NYSenate `licensing page`_.

This is the Java Web app project for the open-source legislative access system developed by the NY Senate beginning in 2009. It provides both a HTML-based browser and search interface, as well as XML and JSON-based RESTful APIs. It has been running live on NYSenate.gov for about 2 years now on our `legislation page`_ and is also used internally to support several applications.

Developers looking to use the API can consult our `API Documentation`_ for more information or contact us on the NYSenate Developers `mailing list`_ or in #nyss_openlegislation channel on `FreeNode`_ (IRC).
