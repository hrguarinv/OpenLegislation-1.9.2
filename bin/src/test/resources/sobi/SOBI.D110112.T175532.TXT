2011S01391 M00001BILL NUMBER:S1391
2011S01391 M00002
2011S01391 M00003TITLE OF BILL:
2011S01391 M00004An act to amend the social services law and the real property law, in
2011S01391 M00005relation to protecting homeless children from lead paint poisoning
2011S01391 M00006
2011S01391 M00007PURPOSE:
2011S01391 M00008To assure that families receiving public assistance and/or other govern-
2011S01391 M00009mental housing subsidies are not placed in hazardous housing.
2011S01391 M00010
2011S01391 M00011SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01391 M00012Section one amends social services law section143-b and creates a new
2011S01391 M00013subsection to bar state and local governmental agencies from arranging
2011S01391 M00014to place families in housing that will be subsidized with state funds
2011S01391 M00015unless the dwelling unit has first been inspected by properly qualified
2011S01391 M00016personnel and determined to be free of lead-based paint hazards.
2011S01391 M00017
2011S01391 M00018Section two amends the real property law to bar discrimination in the
2011S01391 M00019leasing of rental property against families receiving public assistance
2011S01391 M00020or governmental housing subsidies.
2011S01391 M00021
2011S01391 M00022JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01391 M00023Lead poisoning of children persists as one of the most prevalent and
2011S01391 M00024preventable environmental diseases in New York. At least 10,000 children
2011S01391 M00025were newly identified with levels of lead in their blood at 10 micro-
2011S01391 M00026grams per deciliter (ug/dl) in New York State in 2001.  Medical research
2011S01391 M00027indicates that children can suffer permanent, irreparable damage at
2011S01391 M00028blood levels even lower than 10 ug/dl, and that there is no level of
2011S01391 M00029lead ingestion which is without adverse impact.  Medical research also
2011S01391 M00030indicates that fetal injuries from lead paint can occur if women have
2011S01391 M00031elevated blood levels during pregnancy.
2011S01391 M00032
2011S01391 M00033Because of this, intervention measures that wait until children have
2011S01391 M00034been exposed have limited benefits, and the pursuit of primary
2011S01391 M00035prevention, which means eliminating lead hazards before children are
2011S01391 M00036exposed, has been recommended by the United States Centers for Disease
2011S01391 M00037Control and Prevention and promoted by leading experts in the field as a
2011S01391 M00038critical course of action to protect the health of young children.
2011S01391 M00039
2011S01391 M00040Although New York state banned the sale of lead paint in 1970 (1.1970,
2011S01391 M00041ch. 338), seventy-four percent of New York's housing stock was
2011S01391 M00042constructed prior to 1970. At least ninety percent of lead-based paint
2011S01391 M00043still remaining in occupied housing exists in units built before 1960
2011S01391 M00044(when New York City banned lead-based paint). New York State has both
2011S01391 M00045the largest percentage and the largest absolute number of older housing
2011S01391 M00046units with lead paint in the nation.
2011S01391 M00047
2011S01391 M00048The deterioration of lead-based paint in older residences results in
2011S01391 M00049increased expenses each year for the state of New York in the form of
2011S01391 M00050special education and other education expenses, medical care for lead
2011S01391 M00051poisoned children, and expenditures for delinquent youth and others
2011S01391 M00052
2011S01391 M00053needing special supervision. The New York State Department of Health has
2011S01391 M00054called for the elimination of childhood lead poisoning in New York State
2011S01391 M00055by 2010.
2011S01391 M00056
2011S01391 M00057It has recently been reported in various news media that New York City's
2011S01391 M00058department of homeless services has been placing homeless families in
2011S01391 M00059dwelling units without properly inspecting such units first to assure
2011S01391 M00060that they were free of lead-based paint hazards, and that as a result
2011S01391 M00061such families have been placed in housing that is hazardous. Social
2011S01391 M00062Services Law section 143-b was originally enacted because of "certain
2011S01391 M00063
2011S01391 M00064existing evils and abuses *** which have caused many tenants, who are
2011S01391 M00065welfare recipients, to suffer untold hardships, deprivation of services
2011S01391 M00066and deterioration of housing facilities because certain landlords have
2011S01391 M00067been exploiting such tenants by failing to make necessary repairs and by
2011S01391 M00068neglecting to afford necessary services," (Declaration of purpose and
2011S01391 M00069necessity, L.1962, ch. 997, § 1). In upholding the constitutionality of
2011S01391 M00070this law, the New York State Court of Appeals explained that "...
2011S01391 M00071welfare recipients have even less freedom than other tenants of deteri-
2011S01391 M00072orated buildings in selecting a place to live ... and the landlords of
2011S01391 M00073welfare recipients, secure in their receipt of rents directly from
2011S01391 M00074public funds, have even less incentive than other landlords to make
2011S01391 M00075repairs."
2011S01391 M00076MATTER OF FARRELL V. DREW, 19 NY2d 486, 492 (1967).
2011S01391 M00077
2011S01391 M00078This amendment to social services law section l43-b would address the
2011S01391 M00079concern that public funds are misused when they support the placement of
2011S01391 M00080vulnerable families in housing with lead-based paint hazards. In addi-
2011S01391 M00081tion, to address concerns that such amendment would make it more diffi-
2011S01391 M00082cult to find landlords willing to lease dwelling units to those on
2011S01391 M00083public assistance or otherwise receiving governmental rental subsidies,
2011S01391 M00084the real property law would be amended to bar discrimination in the
2011S01391 M00085leasing of rental property such families.

2011S01392 M00003TITLE OF BILL:
2011S01392 M00004An act
2011S01392 M00005to amend the insurance law, in relation to providing for health
2011S01392 M00006insurance coverage for diagnostic screening for colorectal cancer
2011S01392 M00007
2011S01392 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S01392 M00009As April 15th through April 21st is National Minority Cancer Awareness
2011S01392 M00010Week, I am introducing this legislation which requires insurance
2011S01392 M00011coverage for the screening of colorectal cancer.
2011S01392 M00012
2011S01392 M00013SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01392 M00014Every policy issued in New York State providing medical coverage shall
2011S01392 M00015provide the following cover for diagnostic screening for colorectal
2011S01392 M00016cancer:
2011S01392 M00017
2011S01392 M00018* Digital rectal examination at any age for cancer or personal history
2011S01392 M00019of polyps or other possible indicators of the disease.
2011S01392 M00020
2011S01392 M00021* Annual diagnostic examination for people age 40 and over with family
2011S01392 M00022history of other risk factors.
2011S01392 M00023
2011S01392 M00024JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01392 M00025Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in
2011S01392 M00026the united States. The National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance
2011S01392 M00027(NCCRA) estimates that 130,200 new cases of colorectal cancer will be
2011S01392 M00028diagnosed this year with 56,300 deaths due to the disease.
2011S01392 M00029Approximately two' thirds of the deaths from colorectal cancer are
2011S01392 M00030preventable with regular screening and simple prevention techniques.
2011S01392 M00031For most Americans, standard screening with sigmoidoscpy and checking
2011S01392 M00032the stool for blood should begin at the age of 50.
2011S01392 M00033
2011S01392 M00034Colorectal cancer is a disease in which the cells of the colon or
2011S01392 M00035rectum become abnormal and begin to divide without control, forming a
2011S01392 M00036mass called a polyp.
2011S01392 M00037
2011S01392 M00038The implementation of such screenings as are outlined in this bill
2011S01392 M00039would aid in reducing the number of individuals who develop
2011S01392 M00040colorectal cancer while also reducing the number of deaths due to the
2011S01392 M00041disease.

2011S01393 M00004An act
2011S01393 M00005to amend the public authorities law, in relation to enacting the
2011S01393 M00006"public benefits for professional facilities act"
2011S01393 M00007
2011S01393 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S01393 M00009The primary purpose of this bill is to provide an accounting
2011S01393 M00010of all benefits that any state or local authority has granted for the
2011S01393 M00011purpose of construction, reconstruction, repair, or rehabilitation of
2011S01393 M00012a professional sports facility to the legislature, and to condition
2011S01393 M00013such benefits on an affordable ticket agreement.
2011S01393 M00014
2011S01393 M00015SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01393 M00016Section One: Title of bill.
2011S01393 M00017
2011S01393 M00018Section Two of the bill amends the public authorities law by adding a
2011S01393 M00019new title 3-B, Section 2860 which requires that the Empire state
2011S01393 M00020development corporation shall publish on its website and provide to
2011S01393 M00021the legislature an accounting of all benefits that any state or local
2011S01393 M00022authority has granted or obligated itself to grant for the purpose of
2011S01393 M00023construction, reconstruction, repair, or rehabilitation of a
2011S01393 M00024professional sports facility and requires the Empire State
2011S01393 M00025development corporation to publish on its website and provide to the
2011S01393 M00026legislature an update of such accounting by February fifteenth of
2011S01393 M00027each year. This section also requires state and local authorities to
2011S01393 M00028condition any such benefit on an affordable ticket agreement
2011S01393 M00029requiring the recipient of the benefit to offer seven percent of
2011S01393 M00030tickets sold to any sporting event at affordable prices and limits
2011S01393 M00031ticket price increases, in certain circumstances, to no more than two
2011S01393 M00032percent annually for the next ten years. Affordable is defined by
2011S01393 M00033this section as being within the economic ability of persons whose
2011S01393 M00034income is at or below sixty percent of the area median income for a
2011S01393 M00035four-person household. Section two also includes anti-scalping
2011S01393 M00036provisions to prevent the resale of tickets subject to the
2011S01393 M00037agreement at prices above face value.
2011S01393 M00038
2011S01393 M00039Section Three: Sets forth the effective date.
2011S01393 M00040
2011S01393 M00041JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01393 M00042Public authorities often provide enormous subsidies
2011S01393 M00043for construction, reconstruction, repair, or renovation of sports
2011S01393 M00044facilities. The rationale for providing these subsidies is that the
2011S01393 M00045facilities thus created and maintained provide a benefit to the
2011S01393 M00046general public. While such benefit may take many forms the basic
2011S01393 M00047purpose of these facilities--serving as a venue for spectator
2011S01393 M00048sporting events--is often out of reach for New Yorkers with modest
2011S01393 M00049means. This bill would make affordable tickets a required part of the
2011S01393 M00050public benefit we expect when we subsidize these projects.

2011S01394 M00018one (1) by the City Comptroller. The Chair of the board would then be
2011S01394 M00019duly elected by the newly appointed members.
2011S01394 M00020
2011S01394 M00021JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01394 M00022The New York City Water Board sets the rates for water
2011S01394 M00023and sewer fees charged to all building owners, home owners and
2011S01394 M00024businesses in New York City. The members of the Water Board are
2011S01394 M00025currently all Mayoral appointees. This bill would give appointing
2011S01394 M00026power to two other offices of the city government and would offer a
2011S01394 M00027level of accountability to the rate payers.

2011S01395 M00019JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01395 M00020The Authorities Budget Office, whose role was defined
2011S01395 M00021in the groundbreaking. Public Authorities Reform Act of 2009, is an
2011S01395 M00022ever-changing institution whose mission and procedural goals are
2011S01395 M00023still evolving. In light of recent events, it has become clear that
2011S01395 M00024the mandatory imposition of debt reduction practices for all state
2011S01395 M00025authorities will invariably lead to less waste and abuse by state
2011S01395 M00026authorities, and be a useful step forward in creating transparency
2011S01395 M00027and efficiency within these vital government entities.

2011S01396 M00003TITLE OF BILL:
2011S01396 M00004An act
2011S01396 M00005to amend the public service law, in relation to the collection of
2011S01396 M00006charges for residential utility service deemed to be rent
2011S01396 M00007
2011S01396 M00008PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S01396 M00009Bill would ban the deeming of charges for electric service provided by
2011S01396 M00010the landlord to residential tenants to be "rent".
2011S01396 M00011
2011S01396 M00012SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01396 M00013This bill would establish the following provisions:
2011S01396 M00014
2011S01396 M00015* Creates section 75 -a of the public service law to allow that in any
2011S01396 M00016action or proceeding in any court for the collection of gas or
2011S01396 M00017electric charges or for the possession of real property by reason of
2011S01396 M00018an unpaid charge, if the charges for the utility are deemed to be
2011S01396 M00019rent under any arrangement or agreement related to the rental
2011S01396 M00020property this shall be a complete defense to the action;
2011S01396 M00021* Act taking effect immediately.
2011S01396 M00022
2011S01396 M00023JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01396 M00024The Public Service Commission has plenary jurisdiction over the sale
2011S01396 M00025or distribution of electric service under § 5.1.b of the public
2011S01396 M00026service law. Under the public service law, the provision of electric
2011S01396 M00027service by a landlord to a tenant is recognized as a permissible
2011S01396 M00028activity only by "a railroad or street railroad. . . for the use of
2011S01396 M00029its tenants and not for sale to others." Public Service Law §2(13).
2011S01396 M00030The issue whether a residential landlord - who is neither a railroad
2011S01396 M00031nor an electric corporation - can lawfully sell electricity to its
2011S01396 M00032tenants has been questioned in the lower courts but has not been
2011S01396 M00033decided by the court of appeals. (See, e.g., Owners & Tenants
2011S01396 M00034Electric Co., Inc. v. Tractenberg. 158 Misc. 677, at 679 - 680 (Mun.
2011S01396 M00035Ct. N.Y. City 1936¤.
2011S01396 M00036
2011S01396 M00037In 1951 the Public Service Commission (PSC) prohibited all residential
2011S01396 M00038electric submetering, calling the practice "parasitic." That decision
2011S01396 M00039was upheld in the courts. (Campo Corp. v. Feinberg, 279 App. niv.
2011S01396 M00040302, (3d Dept. 1952) affirmed 303 N.Y. 995 (1952). As a consequence,
2011S01396 M00041utilities were directed by the PSC to adopt electric tariffs broadly
2011S01396 M00042prohibiting the resale of utility service. The previously permitted
2011S01396 M00043landlord submetering was converted to direct utility metering.
2011S01396 M00044
2011S01396 M00045Subsequently, the practice of submetering was again allowed by the PSC
2011S01396 M00046on a case by case basis, mainly for residential cooperative and
2011S01396 M00047condominium projects, where tenants have an ownership and governance
2011S01396 M00048interest. Public service commission regulations and numerous orders
2011S01396 M00049have allowed landlords waivers from the general prohibition against
2011S01396 M00050resale of utility service contained in commission regulations and
2011S01396 M00051utility tariffs.
2011S01396 M00052
2011S01396 M00053The PSC allows landlords to provide submetered electric service on a
2011S01396 M00054deregulated or loosely regulated basis and allows landlords to collect
2011S01396 M00055charges for unpaid service by actual or threatened eviction. As a
2011S01396 M00056result, landlords are being allowed to be monopoly providers of
2011S01396 M00057electric service to their captive tenants. Also, in many instances
2011S01396 M00058the state division of housing and community renewal has allowed
2011S01396 M00059landlords who previously rented with utility service included in the
2011S01396 M00060rent to change
2011S01396 M00061the terms of leases so as to shift responsibility for payment of
2011S01396 M00062electric charges from landlords to tenants.
2011S01396 M00063
2011S01396 M00064In its regulations and in its orders granting applications of owners
2011S01396 M00065of residential real property to waive longstanding tariff and
2011S01396 M00066regulatory prohibitions of submetering, the public service commission
2011S01396 M00067acknowledges the applicability of Article 2 of the public service
2011S01396 M00068law, the Home Energy Fair Practices Act (HEFPA), to the landlords in
2011S01396 M00069their new capacity as a provider of utility service. The commission
2011S01396 M00070also allows or approves standard lease provisions which "deem"
2011S01396 M00071charges for utility service to be "additional rent" due the landlord
2011S01396 M00072under the lease. These "additional rent" provisions give landlords a
2011S01396 M00073claim to evict tenants for unpaid "rent" which really includes
2011S01396 M00074charges for utility service.
2011S01396 M00075
2011S01396 M00076The legislature has carefully designed programs designed to protect
2011S01396 M00077utility customers from abuse, such as HEFPA, and has created safety
2011S01396 M00078nets for the needy in the emergency utility assistance program under
2011S01396 M00079social services law § 131-s and the energy crisis provisions of the
2011S01396 M00080home energy assistance program under social services law § 97 (HEAP).
2011S01396 M00081Assistance in these programs is triggered by a notice of termination
2011S01396 M00082of utility service, and is not available when a landlord attempts to
2011S01396 M00083evict tenants for unpaid rent. As a result, tenants who have
2011S01396 M00084temporary difficulty in meeting their obligations to pay for utility
2011S01396 M00085service are in a far worse position than direct utility customers,
2011S01396 M00086who cannot be evicted from their homes by the provider of utility
2011S01396 M00087service over unpaid or disputed charges, who have the opportunity to
2011S01396 M00088pay arrears over time in affordable installments through deferred
2011S01396 M00089payment plans which must be offered as an alternative to termination
2011S01396 M00090of utility service, and who have the opportunity to obtain emergency
2011S01396 M00091HEAP or 131-s assistance if alternative payment arrangements with the
2011S01396 M00092utility cannot be afforded.
2011S01396 M00093
2011S01396 M00094A "Residential Electrical Submetering Manual" published in 2001 by the
2011S01396 M00095New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA)
2011S01396 M00096suggests to landlords who provide submetered electric service to
2011S01396 M00097their tenants that they may evict tenants in court proceedings as an
2011S01396 M00098alternative to complying with the Home Energy Fair Practices Act
2011S01396 M00099(HEFPA):

2011S01396 M00100
2011S01396 M00101There are two potential remedies for an owner if a resident fails or
2011S01396 M00102refuses to pay submetered electric charges. One is to discontinue
2011S01396 M00103supplying the electric service. The other is to sue for either
2011S01396 M00104recovery of the unpaid amounts or eviction.
2011S01396 M00105
2011S01396 M00106As noted in the section discussing PSC requirements, New York State
2011S01396 M00107has extensive regulations in place to protect residents against their
2011S01396 M00108electric service being shut off. An owner seeking to continue the
2011S01396 M00109tenancy while discontinuing the service will most likely be required
2011S01396 M00110to comply with all tenant-protection regulations applicable to
2011S01396 M00111utilities for discontinuing the service. These include various notice
2011S01396 M00112and payout requirements and protection for the elderly and disabled,
2011S01396 M00113which are time-consuming, burdensome to the owner, and inconsistent
2011S01396 M00114with continuation
2011S01396 M00115of the rental tenancy. Moreover, special arrangements with
2011S01396 M00116respect to electric charges are likely to cause confusion in billing
2011S01396 M00117and collection procedures. As a result, owners may want to consider
2011S01396 M00118legal action for eviction of the resident or recovery of unpaid
2011S01396 M00119amounts as the primary enforcement mechanism for nonpayment of
2011S01396 M00120submetered electric charges.
2011S01396 M00121
2011S01396 M00122Thus, rather than provide tenants in financial difficulty ample notice
2011S01396 M00123and the opportunity to pay arrears over time through deferred payment
2011S01396 M00124agreements required to be offered under HEFPA, rather than provide
2011S01396 M00125detailed HEFPA notices to the elderly and disabled which require
2011S01396 M00126referral to public assistance if they cannot make arrangements,
2011S01396 M00127landlords are being encouraged to evade HEFPA requirements and to
2011S01396 M00128bring tenants with unpaid electric charges to court seeking court
2011S01396 M00129judgments and eviction orders.
2011S01396 M00130
2011S01396 M00131The deeming of utility service to be "additional rent" subjecting a
2011S01396 M00132utility customer to eviction at the hands of an owner who provides
2011S01396 M00133monopoly utility service under PSC orders is resulting in
2011S01396 M00134displacement, hardship and injustice to submetered tenants, who are
2011S01396 M00135often unrepresented in court proceedings, and is adding to the burden
2011S01396 M00136of the courts.
2011S01396 M00137One example of a landlord's lease with such a rider, that was approved
2011S01396 M00138for submetering by the Commission, reads as follows: "The electricity
2011S01396 M00139charges will be billed to the Tenant as additional rent and will be
2011S01396 M00140payable on a monthly basis by the Tenant as additional rent. Tenant
2011S01396 M00141specifically understands that if the electricity charges are not paid
2011S01396 M00142in full on a monthly basis by the Tenant, that the Landlord may
2011S01396 M00143commence a summary proceeding to recover a money judgment and a
2011S01396 M00144judgment for possession against the Tenant and that the Tenant can be
2011S01396 M00145evicted from the apartment for failure to pay electricity charges."
2011S01396 M00146
2011S01396 M00147Some courts have prohibited submetering landlords from terminating
2011S01396 M00148tenancies for unpaid electric charges (see Related Tiffany, L.P. v.
2011S01396 M00149McConeyhead, N.Y. City Civil Court L&T No. 55444/04, June 30, 2004) on
2011S01396 M00150the ground that the "deeming" language of the landlord's lease does
2011S01396 M00151not work to convert utility charges due into rent. In contrast, some
2011S01396 M00152court decisions have allowed judgments and evictions for unpaid
2011S01396 M00153charges for utility service provided by the landlord that were
2011S01396 M00154contractually defined as "rent." This bill would clarify that unpaid
2011S01396 M00155charges for residential utility service cannot be the basis for an
2011S01396 M00156eviction proceeding.
2011S01396 M00157
2011S01396 M00158This bill will bring to a halt the growing use of the landlord tenant
2011S01396 M00159courts by landlords to collect charges for unpaid electric service as
2011S01396 M00160"additional rent." It will not affect any right the landlord may have
2011S01396 M00161to collect its charges through conventional means, such as an action
2011S01396 M00162for damages, and it will not affect any right the landlord may have,
2011S01396 M00163after complying with HEFPA, to cease providing utility service if the
2011S01396 M00164tenant does not pay. The bill will halt the evasion of HEFPA
2011S01396 M00165compliance, will enable needy tenants to obtain energy assistance
2011S01396 M00166triggered by advance termination notices, and will channel disputes
2011S01396 M00167over utility charges away from the courts and back to the public
2011S01396 M00168service commission's complaint handling and decision process under
2011S01396 M00169HEFPA, i.e., section 43.2.

2011S01397 M00013issued in the last five years to determine compliance by building
2011S01397 M00014owners of utility price caps and tenant protection provisions, and to
2011S01397 M00015determine if submetering has resulted in energy savings in those
2011S01397 M00016buildings. The Commission will have twelve months to complete the

2011S01397 M00053As a result, landlords are being allowed to be monopoly providers of
2011S01397 M00054electric service to their captive tenants. Also, in many instances

2011S01397 M00058change the terms of leases so as to shift responsibility for payment
2011S01397 M00059of electric charges from landlords to tenants.
2011S01397 M00060Recently, submetering has been recast as an environmental cause,
2011S01397 M00061encouraging consumers to conserve energy by making them directly
2011S01397 M00062responsible for the costs associated with their dwelling unit's
2011S01397 M00063energy usage. But as utility costs rise some building owners have
2011S01397 M00064begun to see this as a way to pass high costs on to their tenants,
2011S01397 M00065and as building owners are not obligated to reveal energy
2011S01397 M00066inefficiencies in their buildings as part of their applications (nor
2011S01397 M00067are they required to make efficiency improvements), these costs can
2011S01397 M00068be very high.
2011S01397 M00069This bill will allow the legislature to review the current practices
2011S01397 M00070of submetering and ensure that the goals of energy conservation are
2011S01397 M00071more than theoretical, that tenants are being protected as per the
2011S01397 M00072submetering orders, and that all applicable utility price caps are
2011S01397 M00073adhered to.
2011S01397 M00074If not, the findings and recommendations of the commission's audit
2011S01397 M00075should be helpful in making a public policy determination of what
2011S01397 M00076should happen next on this subject.

2011S01398 M00007
2011S01398 M00008PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S01398 M00009To provide for a transparent procedure by which a private or

2011S01398 M00011shall make certain facts of the building known that pertain to its
2011S01398 M00012energy efficiency, require minimum improvements to the building for
2011S01398 M00013energy efficiency, and provide for tenant input as the application is
2011S01398 M00014considered by the Public Service Commission.
2011S01398 M00015
2011S01398 M00016SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01398 M00017The public service law is amended to:

2011S01398 M00060tenants request such analysis and at least 3 bids are received by the
2011S01398 M00061applicant;
2011S01398 M00062
2011S01398 M00063-Act taking effect immediately.
2011S01398 M00064
2011S01398 M00065JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01398 M00066In 1951, the Public Service Commission prohibited all residential
2011S01398 M00067electric submetering, calling the practice "parasitic." That decision
2011S01398 M00068was held up in courts (Campo Corp. v. Feinberg, 279 App. Div. 302 (3d
2011S01398 M00069Dept.
2011S01398 M000701952) affirmed 303 N.Y. 995 (1952). As a consequence, utilities were
2011S01398 M00071directed by the PSC to adopt electric tariffs broadly prohibiting the
2011S01398 M00072resale of utility service. The previously permitted landlord
2011S01398 M00073submetering was converted to direct utility metering.
2011S01398 M00074
2011S01398 M00075Subsequently, the practice of submetering was again allowed by the
2011S01398 M00076PSC on a case by case basis, mainly for residential cooperative and
2011S01398 M00077condominium projects, where tenants have an ownership and governance
2011S01398 M00078interest. Public service commission regulations and numerous orders
2011S01398 M00079have allowed landlords waivers from the general prohibition against
2011S01398 M00080resale of utility service contained in commission regulations and
2011S01398 M00081utility tariffs.
2011S01398 M00082As a result, landlords are being allowed to be monopoly providers of
2011S01398 M00083electric service to their captive tenants. Also, in many instances
2011S01398 M00084the state division of housing and community renewal has allowed
2011S01398 M00085landlords who previously rented with utility service included in the
2011S01398 M00086rent to change the terms of leases so as to shift responsibility for
2011S01398 M00087payment of electric charges from landlords to tenants.
2011S01398 M00088
2011S01398 M00089To safeguard the rights of tenants, it is important to ensure that the
2011S01398 M00090submetering application process is transparent and affords affected
2011S01398 M00091residents the opportunity to comment on the application as well as
2011S01398 M00092ensuring that the thermal characteristics of the building are known,
2011S01398 M00093deficiencies in energy efficiency are reasonably mitigated, and that
2011S01398 M00094there are checks in place to safeguard against tenants being unduly
2011S01398 M00095burdened from unjust and unreasonable submetered charges.

2011S01399 M00008
2011S01399 M00009PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S01399 M00010To ensure that residential utility
2011S01399 M00011customers, including submetered customers, are provided annual notice
2011S01399 M00012of their right to access the public Service Commission's complaint
2011S01399 M00013process.
2011S01399 M00014
2011S01399 M00015SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01399 M00016-Amends subdivision 1 of section 43 of
2011S01399 M00017the public service law, as added by chapter 713 of the laws of 19B1
2011S01399 M00018to require the Public Service Commission to maintain regulations
2011S01399 M00019requiring municipalities and utilities annually notify all
2011S01399 M00020residential utility customers, including submetered customers, that
2011S01399 M00021the complaint handling procedures of the Commission can be invoked
2011S01399 M00022for an administrative determination of their complaint by telephone
2011S01399 M00023call, letter, online complaint form, or a visit to the office of the
2011S01399 M00024commission;
2011S01399 M00025
2011S01399 M00026-Act taking effect on the ninetieth day after it becomes law.
2011S01399 M00027
2011S01399 M00028JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01399 M00029The Public Service commission has long had primary
2011S01399 M00030jurisdiction over customer disputes regarding utility service, which
2011S01399 M00031are decided administratively subject to judicial review of final
2011S01399 M00032decisions under CPLR Article 7B. For residential customers the
2011S01399 M00033requirements for prompt and simple utility and administrative agency
2011S01399 M00034complaint determination procedures are now contained in the Home
2011S01399 M00035Energy Fair Practices Act (HEFPA), Public Service Law (PSL) 30, et
2011S01399 M00036seg. PSL Section 43.1 requires all utilities, upon receiving a
2011S01399 M00037customer complaint, to have procedures for a "prompt investigation of
2011S01399 M00038any complaint," and for "prompt reporting to the complainant of the
2011S01399 M00039result of such investigation." After any report of the utility
2011S01399 M00040adverse to the customer, the utility is required to "inform any
2011S01399 M00041complainant... of the availability of the commission's complaint
2011S01399 M00042handling procedures."
2011S01399 M00043
2011S01399 M00044The bill is necessary to correct current complaint handling practices
2011S01399 M00045of some providers of utility service and the public Service
2011S01399 M00046Commission (PSC) which have had the effect of diverting complaints
2011S01399 M00047regarding electric service to outside third parties for arbitration
2011S01399 M00048or adjudication or deterring customers from lodging complaints. This
2011S01399 M00049impedes the provision of service in accordance with HEFPA and thwarts
2011S01399 M00050the prompt and efficient resolution of electricity customer complaints.
2011S01399 M00051
2011S01399 M00052Before 2002, despite a longstanding regulation requiring landlords
2011S01399 M00053providing submetered electric service to implement complaint procedures
2011S01399 M00054"consistent with HEFPA," 16 NYCRR Part 96.2, some PSC orders approving
2011S01399 M00055landlords' petitions for submetering approval mention complaint
2011S01399 M00056procedures which involve third party determinations, such as
2011S01399 M00057arbitration or court proceedings. despite the applicability of the
2011S01399 M00058PSC complaint handling procedures.
2011S01399 M00059
2011S01399 M00060Some examples follow:
2011S01399 M00061

2011S01399 M00063Hazel Towers Submetering Order ("Upon receipt of the protest, the
2011S01399 M00064matter shall be turned over to a grievance arbitrator. The
2011S01399 M00065arbitrator, to be selected from the American Arbitration Association
2011S01399 M00066or equivalent. . ."); 1998 Ruppert/Yorkville Towers Submetering Order
2011S01399 M00067("The arbitrator, to be selected from the American Arbitration

2011S01399 M00070to all parties");
2011S01399 M00071
2011S01399 M00072Non-binding arbitration: 2001 Ebbetts Field Apartments Submetering
2011S01399 M00073Order ("the submetering plan does not provide for binding
2011S01399 M00074arbitration, only arbitration");
2011S01399 M00075
2011S01399 M00076Arbitration followed by PSC complaint process: 2008 1 Alexander
2011S01399 M00077Street, Yonkers Submetering Order ("The property manager will submit
2011S01399 M00078the grievance to an independent arbitrator selected from the American
2011S01399 M00079Arbitration Association or equivalent, at no cost to the tenant. The
2011S01399 M00080decision of the arbitrator w ill be provided to the tenant promptly
2011S01399 M00081with notice of the arbitration procedures. If the tenant is
2011S01399 M00082dissatisfied with the decision of the arbitrator, either party may
2011S01399 M00083file a complaint with the Commission pursuant to the Home Energy Fair
2011S01399 M00084Practices Act (HEFPA)). New York City Landlord-tenant court
2011S01399 M00085proceedings: 2008 City of New York, Roosevelt Landings (Eastwood)
2011S01399 M00086Submetering Order, ("If a resident remains dissatisfied, the
2011S01399 M00087resident, within fifteen' (IS) days of management's response, may
2011S01399 M00088request in writing that the grievance be submitted to the New York
2011S01399 M00089City Civil Court Housing, Landlord/Tenant Court");
2011S01399 M00090
2011S01399 M00091The New York City Department of Housing Development and Preservation:
2011S01399 M000921997 North Waterside Plaza Submetering Order ("If the complainant is
2011S01399 M00093dissatisfied with the managing agent's response, he or she may
2011S01399 M00094request a review of said determination by filing a written protest
2011S01399 M00095within fourteen days from the date of the response to HPD").
2011S01399 M00096
2011S01399 M00097These alternative venues for complaint adjudication all involve time
2011S01399 M00098consuming and comparatively formal proceedings. They may also prove
2011S01399 M00099to be expensive and risky, for example, if an eviction case is the
2011S01399 M00000.SO DOC S 1399                                   MTXT                 2011
2011S01399 M00100forum for resolution. These factors may serve to deter customers with
2011S01399 M00101meritorious complaints from making them, and reduce awareness at the
2011S01399 M00102Public Service Commission of the nature and quality of customer
2011S01399 M00103service actually provided by certain utilities.
2011S01399 M00104
2011S01399 M00105Such alternative complaint procedures are inconsistent with the
2011S01399 M00106Commission's primary jurisdiction over electric service and with the
2011S01399 M00107express HEFPA requirements in PSL section 43 of a "prompt
2011S01399 M00108investigation" and "prompt reporting of the result of such
2011S01399 M00109investigation," with information provided to the customer "of the
2011S01399 M00110availability of the commission's complaint handling procedures."
2011S01399 M00111
2011S01399 M00112In 2002, the legislature adopted the Energy Consumer Protection Act, and
2011S01399 M00113a new PSL Section 53 clearly eliminated any power of the PSC to allow
2011S01399 M00114anything less than "full compliance" with HEFPA or to waive any
2011S01399 M00115provision of HEFPA for submeterers:
2011S01399 M00116
2011S01399 M00117§ 53. Application. For purposes of this article, a reference to a gas
2011S01399 M00118corporation, an electric corporation, a utility company, or a utility
2011S01399 M00119corporation shall include, but is not limited to, any entity that, in
2011S01399 M00120any manner, sells or facilitates the sale or furnishing of gas or
2011S01399 M00121electricity to residential customers. No provision of this article or
2011S01399 M00122of this chapter authorizes or permits the provision of gas or
2011S01399 M00123electricity service by any such corporation or other entity in any
2011S01399 M00124manner other than in JO compliance with the provisions of this
2011S01399 M00125article or to authorize the
2011S01399 M00126commission to waive compliance with any requirement of this article
2011S01399 M00127for any such corporation or other entity.
2011S01399 M00128
2011S01399 M00129After enactment of ECPA, the PSC amended its customer complaint
2011S01399 M00130handling regulations to reflect that term "utilities" includes
2011S01399 M00131"owners of submetered residential buildings." 16 NYCRR § 12.0. The
2011S01399 M00132Commission rule was upheld in a court challenge, Waterside Plaza, LLC
2011S01399 M00133v. NYPSC (Albany County Index No. 7654/05), Opinion dated July 3,
2011S01399 M001342006 ("Those who submeter electricity for sale to residential
2011S01399 M00135end-users are utilities within the meaning of Article 2 of the PSL.
2011S01399 M00136Accordingly, those entities must provide all HEFPA protections.").
2011S01399 M00137One of the HEFPA protections is notification of customers regarding
2011S01399 M00138their opportunity to have a complaint about utility service resolved
2011S01399 M00139by the Public Service Commission. PSL § 43
2011S01399 M00140
2011S01399 M00141Subsequently, however, the PSC issued many submetering orders which

2011S01399 M00143procedures for resolution of complaints regarding utility service.
2011S01399 M00144There is no basis in existing law for referral of the customer's
2011S01399 M00145dispute to court or arbitration. Such procedures for referral of
2011S01399 M00146complaints to third parties deviate from the statutory procedures
2011S01399 M00147established in PSL § 43.
2011S01399 M00148As a result of the practices of the PSC and submeterers, many
2011S01399 M00149submetered residential customers are confused or misinformed
2011S01399 M00150regarding the statutory complaint procedures which actually apply to
2011S01399 M00151disputes regarding their electric service.

2011S01400 M00004An act
2011S01400 M00005to amend the criminal procedure law, in relation to the electronic
2011S01400 M00006recording of interrogations
2011S01400 M00007
2011S01400 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S01400 M00009The purpose of this act is to require the creation of an electronic
2011S01400 M00010record of an entire custodial interrogation in order to eliminate
2011S01400 M00011disputes in court as to what actually occurred during the
2011S01400 M00012interrogation, thereby improving prosecution of the guilty while
2011S01400 M00013affording protection to the innocent.
2011S01400 M00014
2011S01400 M00015SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01400 M00016Section 1 of the bill adds §60.47 to the Criminal Procedure Law. This
2011S01400 M00017act will require the electronic recording of all custodial
2011S01400 M00018interrogations at places of detention. If a recording is not made of
2011S01400 M00019the interrogation, then any statements by the accused are presumed
2011S01400 M00020inadmissible as evidence in any criminal proceeding charging a felony
2011S01400 M00021offense.
2011S01400 M00022
2011S01400 M00023Section 2 of the bill provides for suppression of evidence obtained in
2011S01400 M00024violation of the new section §60.47.
2011S01400 M00025
2011S01400 M00026Section 3 of the bill provides that if the prosecution intends to
2011S01400 M00027offer a statement of the defendant at trial, notice must be given as
2011S01400 M00028to whether such statement was electronically recorded.
2011S01400 M00029
2011S01400 M00030Section 4 of the bill provides the effective date.
2011S01400 M00031
2011S01400 M00032JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01400 M00033The practice of electronically recording complete custodial
2011S01400 M00034interrogations has been on the increase both in the state and in the
2011S01400 M00035country.
2011S01400 M00036The benefits of recording interviews are obvious and the value in
2011S01400 M00037doing so has been widely recognized. Recording insures the integrity
2011S01400 M00038of the fact finding process by recording accurately the full course
2011S01400 M00039of the interrogation and reducing false denials that incriminating
2011S01400 M00040admissions were made, or that such admissions were obtained by
2011S01400 M00041coercion or intimidation. Recording also improves the quality of
2011S01400 M00042police interrogations through easier monitoring by supervisors, use
2011S01400 M00043of recordings for training purposes and the use of taped admissions
2011S01400 M00044to confront suspected accomplices. Finally, recording helps prevent
2011S01400 M00045the ill treatment of detainees and reduces the likelihood that the
2011S01400 M00046detainee can lodge false complaints of physical or psychological abuse.
2011S01400 M00047
2011S01400 M00048Where the practice of mandated recording has been implemented, law
2011S01400 M00049enforcement organizations---even those initially opposed---have
2011S01400 M00050almost universally found the practice beneficial.

2011S01401 M00004An act
2011S01401 M00005to amend the workers' compensation law, in relation to setting a time
2011S01401 M00006limit for requesting full board review of unanimous board panel
2011S01401 M00007decisions
2011S01401 M00008
2011S01401 M00009PURPOSE:
2011S01401 M00010This bill sets a 3D-day time limit for requesting review by the full
2011S01401 M00011Board of a unanimous Workers' compensation Board panel decision, and
2011S01401 M00012bars applicants who request review by the full Board from merely
2011S01401 M00013resubmitting the same application for review they had presented to
2011S01401 M00014the Boardpanel.
2011S01401 M00015
2011S01401 M00016SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01401 M00017Section 1 of the bill amends Workers' compensation Law § 23 to apply
2011S01401 M00018the 30-day time limit for appeals to both appeals from a divided
2011S01401 M00019panel ("mandatory" appeals) and appeals from a unanimous panel
2011S01401 M00020("discretionary" appeals). It further requires that any appeal to the
2011S01401 M00021full Board must raise arguments concerning the deficiencies of the
2011S01401 M00022panel's decision.
2011S01401 M00023
2011S01401 M00024Section 2 of the bill amends workers' compensation Law § 142(2) to
2011S01401 M00025require that a discretionary appeal be made in conformity with
2011S01401 M00026Workers' Compensation Law § 23.
2011S01401 M00027
2011S01401 M00028Section 3 of the bill provides that the bill will apply to all
2011S01401 M00029requests for review of panel decisions issued ninety or more days
2011S01401 M00030after the effective date.
2011S01401 M00031
2011S01401 M00032EXISTING LAW:
2011S01401 M00033The Workers' compensation Law allows a party in interest to appeal
2011S01401 M00034from a decision of a panel of the Board, where there is a dissent,
2011S01401 M00035within thirty days of the filing of the decision with the Board's
2011S01401 M00036secretary.
2011S01401 M00037This is known as "mandatory" review since the Board must review the
2011S01401 M00038decision. The statute does not require that the application point to
2011S01401 M00039errors in the panel decision, nor does it specifically address
2011S01401 M00040requests for full Board review of unanimous Board panel decisions.
2011S01401 M00041Appeal from a unanimous decision is permitted under Workers'
2011S01401 M00042Compensation Law § 123, which provides for the Board's continuing
2011S01401 M00043jurisdiction over cases, and workers' compensation Law § 142(2),
2011S01401 M00044which states that the decision of a Board panel shall be final except
2011S01401 M00045"on application by a party in interest" for a Board review. Review of
2011S01401 M00046such an appeal is known as "discretionary" because it is within the
2011S01401 M00047Board's discretion to accept or decline requests
2011S01401 M00048for full Board review of unanimous decisions. There is currently no
2011S01401 M00049time limit for parties to request discretionary full Board review.

2011S01401 M00055
2011S01401 M00056STATEMENT IN SUPPORT:
2011S01401 M00057Under current law, those who appeal a Board panel's decision as of
2011S01401 M00058right when there is a dissent on the panel have only 30 days to do
2011S01401 M00059so. There is no time limit, however, on parties seeking discretionary
2011S01401 M00060review of unanimous Board panel decisions. This results in the
2011S01401 M00061anomaly that losing parties have more time to appeal a unanimous
2011S01401 M00062decision than they have to appeal a Board panel decision where they
2011S01401 M00063were able to persuade one of the three members that their position
2011S01401 M00064was correct. As a result, discretionary appeals sometimes are filed
2011S01401 M00065with the Board months after a panel decision. This bill would provide
2011S01401 M00066the same 3D-day time limit for requesting discretionary full board
2011S01401 M00067review of unanimous Board panel decisions as currently applies for
2011S01401 M00068requesting mandatory full Board review of panel decisions where there
2011S01401 M00069is a dissent.
2011S01401 M00070
2011S01401 M00071This bill also addresses a separate problem with appellate review by
2011S01401 M00072the full Board. At present, many appellants who request full Board
2011S01401 M00073review from either unanimous or 2-1 Board panel decisions simply
2011S01401 M00074resubmit the application they had submitted to the Board panel with a
2011S01401 M00075cover letter, essentially seeking two bites of the apple with no
2011S01401 M00076arguments or analysis addressing the intervening Board panel
2011S01401 M00077decision. Such additional filing requires virtually no cost or
2011S01401 M00078effort, but adds significantly to the workload of the Board. The bill
2011S01401 M00079remedies this problem by requiring that the application for Board
2011S01401 M00080review specifically address the panel decision.

2011S01402 M00013
2011S01402 M00014SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01402 M00015Sections 1 and 2 of the bill amend section 220(2) of the labor law to
2011S01402 M00016extend prevailing wage requirements to public work projects by
2011S01402 M00017charter schools. Prevailing wage requirements would also be extended
2011S01402 M00018to leases, grants, bonds, covenants, debt agreements, and permits
2011S01402 M00019entered into for public work.
2011S01402 M00020
2011S01402 M00021section 3 of the bill amends subdivision 3(a) of section 2853 of the

2011S01402 M00047JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01402 M00048
2011S01402 M00049Charter schools are publicly funded by the State and serve the
2011S01402 M00050important public purpose of educating children. Charter schools are
2011S01402 M00051now located throughout New York as a result of new construction or
2011S01402 M00052
2011S01402 M00053improvements to existing buildings performed by workers. Article 8 of
2011S01402 M00054the labor law and the state constitution have long required the
2011S01402 M00055payment of prevailing wages for public work construction projects by
2011S01402 M00056state and local entities, including school districts and public
2011S01402 M00057universities. Unfortunately, workers who build charter schools lack
2011S01402 M00058the same prevailing wage and hour protections as employees who build
2011S01402 M00059other public work projects since Article B has not been amended to
2011S01402 M00060recognize this new form of public work. Similarly, employees who
2011S01402 M00061perform building service work at charter schools are denied the same
2011S01402 M00062prevailing wage protection afforded to other building service workers
2011S01402 M00063under Article 9 of the labor law. This legislation will ensure that
2011S01402 M00064these two groups of workers are provided the same basic prevailing
2011S01402 M00065wage protection as other employees who perform similar work. The
2011S01402 M00066construction contract would also be subject to the same competitive
2011S01402 M00067bidding requirements as other public work contracts in order to widen
2011S01402 M00068bidding opportunities for more contractors in New York.

2011S01403 M00015B of Chapter 57 of the Laws of 2008 to read as follows:  To the
2011S01403 M00016Yonkers City School district there shall be paid seventeen million
2011S01403 M00017five hundred thousand dollars multiplied by such district's
2011S01403 M00018regional cost index.
2011S01403 M00019
2011S01403 M00020JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01403 M00021Regional cost indexes were recently adopted under the State's new
2011S01403 M00022Foundation Aid formula for public education. Certain school districts,
2011S01403 M00023however, may also receive supplemental educational improvement plan
2011S01403 M00024grants, which are designed to provide additional State funds for the
2011S01403 M00025continuation of programs and services under a court ordered plan. These
2011S01403 M00026funds should also be subject to the regional cost differences accounted

2011S01404 M00004An act
2011S01404 M00005to amend the penal law and the criminal procedure law, in relation to
2011S01404 M00006street gang crimes
2011S01404 M00007
2011S01404 M00008PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S01404 M00009Provides for the imposition of an additional determinate sentence of
2011S01404 M00010imprisonment for the commission of a felony as part of a street gang.
2011S01404 M00011
2011S01404 M00012SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01404 M00013Section 1 amends the penal law by adding a new article 475 to define
2011S01404 M00014street gang crime as group of two or more who share common
2011S01404 M00015characteristics and collaborate on crimes and require during
2011S01404 M00016sentencing:
2011S01404 M00017
2011S01404 M00018a) additional 2 (mandatory minimum) to 5 years based on judge's
2011S01404 M00019discretion for offenses committed as part of a gang
2011S01404 M00020
2011S01404 M00021b) additional 10 years for any violent crimes
2011S01404 M00022
2011S01404 M00023Section 2 amends the criminal procedure law subdivision 7 of section
2011S01404 M00024200.50 adding a new paragraph to allow for enhanced penalties.
2011S01404 M00025
2011S01404 M00026Section 3 sets effective date as 1st of November succeeding the date
2011S01404 M00027the bill shall become law.
2011S01404 M00028
2011S01404 M00029JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01404 M00030The need to address the rising criminal activity that has been
2011S01404 M00031attributed to street gangs has become evident. Although reports
2011S01404 M00032concerning the level of gang activity in New York are conflicting, no
2011S01404 M00033one can deny that gang violence has become a reality in New York. It
2011S01404 M00034is no longer uncommon for gangs to solicit youngsters in elementary
2011S01404 M00035schools to join their criminal activity. Tougher, new laws are
2011S01404 M00036required to break up these gangs. It is time to start going after
2011S01404 M00037gangs as we did with organized crime.
2011S01404 M00038
2011S01404 M00039Gang violence hurts especially smaller cities. A study of troubled
2011S01404 M00040youth in Rochester showed that gang members accounted for 68 percent
2011S01404 M00041of all the violent acts of delinquency among the youths studied in
2011S01404 M00042that city. Gang violence, however, also spread across suburban
2011S01404 M00043communities in New York State. Best estimates put gang membership at
2011S01404 M000443,000 to 5,000 in more than 42 gangs in Nassau County with as many or
2011S01404 M00045more members in Suffolk County, according to 2004 Caught in the
2011S01404 M00046Crossfire: Arresting Long Island Gang Violence by Investing in Kids
2011S01404 M00047report by FIGHT CRIME: INVEST IN KIDS, a national, bipartisan,
2011S01404 M00048nonprofit anti-crime organization.
2011S01404 M00049
2011S01404 M00050New York is one of the few states that does not provide additional
2011S01404 M00051tools to law enforcement and to the courts to fight the recruitment,
2011S01404 M00052
2011S01404 M00053retention and coercion of gang members to Continue to expand their
2011S01404 M00054illegal enterprises.
2011S01404 M00055This legislation would require enhanced Sentences for crimes committed
2011S01404 M00056by gang members. Such legislation would offer a deterrent for teens
2011S01404 M00057to join the gangs and especially to commit crimes as part of the
2011S01404 M00058gang. This would also help to deter teens by educating them about
2011S01404 M00059such laws. Laws similar to this one are very successful in
2011S01404 M00060California, New Jersey, and Florida.

2011S01405 M00004An act

2011S01405 M00006
2011S01405 M00007PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S01405 M00008This bill would end years of the most blatant discriminatory
2011S01405 M00009regulation against the consumers of chiropractic. Doctors of
2011S01405 M00010chiropractor have been paid one flat fee for all treatment services
2011S01405 M00011rendered to an injured worker for 31 years while all other providers
2011S01405 M00012including non-doctor providers are paid for virtually every service
2011S01405 M00013they perform. Doctors of Chiropractic are mandated by statute to
2011S01405 M00014provide the same level of care to an injured worker as that of a
2011S01405 M00015private patient but are not reimbursed for the services. Doctors of
2011S01405 M00016Chiropractic are given only a flat "limited office visit" fee. No
2011S01405 M00017other state has a separate and distinct Workers' Compensation fee
2011S01405 M00018schedule/for Doctors of Chiropractic. Doctors of Chiropractic are not
2011S01405 M00019even reimbursed for a main staple of their practice, spinal
2011S01405 M00020adjustments. (AKA spinal manipulation). This policy forces health
2011S01405 M00021care consumers to consult additional providers for these services.
2011S01405 M00022This legislation would recognize that chiropractors provide a variety
2011S01405 M00023of services and to clarify that the workers' compensation system must
2011S01405 M00024pay for the individual modalities employed by chiropractors in
2011S01405 M00025rendering primary health care services to injured workers.
2011S01405 M00026
2011S01405 M00027SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01405 M00028Section 1 amends the Workers' Compensation Law to provide that the
2011S01405 M00029Workers' Compensation Board must reimburse chiropractors for
2011S01405 M00030individual services and modalities lawfully rendered by chiropractors
2011S01405 M00031in treatment of an injured worker. Section 2 sets forth the effective
2011S01405 M00032date of this amendment.
2011S01405 M00033
2011S01405 M00034JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01405 M00035In rendering care, chiropractors, like all other primary care
2011S01405 M00036practitioners, engage in a number of individual diagnostic and
2011S01405 M00037treatment services and modalities. Most other primary care providers
2011S01405 M00038are compensated by the Workers' Compensation System for each discrete
2011S01405 M00039service rendered in diagnosing and treating injured workers. For
2011S01405 M00040example, both the medical and physical therapy fee schedule under
2011S01405 M00041Workers' Compensation is a number of pages long, listing and
2011S01405 M00042compensating the full range of individual medical services employed
2011S01405 M00043in caring for injured workers. Although Workers' Compensation
2011S01405 M00044ostensibly recognize the panoply of chiropractic services, the fee
2011S01405 M00045schedule confines payment to office visits. However, there is no
2011S01405 M00046recognition that a variety of individual chiropractic modalities are
2011S01405 M00047routinely employed in accurately diagnosing and treating injured
2011S01405 M00048workers. This bill recognizes the full scope of chiropractic services
2011S01405 M00049and directs the Board to pay for individual diagnostic and treatment
2011S01405 M00050services and modalities rendered.

2011S01406 M00014Psychiatric Center from the State Office of Mental Health to the
2011S01406 M00015Richardson Center Corporation to meet the needs of the reuse for this

2011S01406 M00037JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01406 M00038The board of the Richardson Center Corporation (RCC)
2011S01406 M00039was appointed in July, 2006 by then New York State Governor George
2011S01406 M00040Pataki. The Richardson Complex reuse has an allocation of 576.5
2011S01406 M00041million in New York State funds.
2011S01406 M00042
2011S01406 M00043The Richardson Center Corporation has advanced a sound planning
2011S01406 M00044process, undertaken vital collaborations, conducted stabilization and
2011S01406 M00045is moving towards implementation.
2011S01406 M00046
2011S01406 M00047The Richardson Olmsted Complex is recognized as a remarkable
2011S01406 M00048achievement of the great American architect Henry Hobson Richardson,
2011S01406 M00049the father of landscape design Fredrick Law Olmsted, and the
2011S01406 M00050innovative psychiatrist
2011S01406 M00051and father of the American Psychiatric Association Dr. Thomas Story

2011S01406 M00053Kirkbride. "When it was built in the late 1800's the Buffalo state
2011S01406 M00054Asylum for the Insane was a progressive facility; a harmonious blend
2011S01406 M00055of state-of-the-art structures and a healing landscape to produce a
2011S01406 M00056therapeutic environment
2011S01406 M00057
2011S01406 M00058The culmination of the planning efforts is the Master Plan and Generic
2011S01406 M00059Environmental Impact Statement which provides phased reuse scenarios.
2011S01406 M00060The first phase of development will start with the Core Project: a
2011S01406 M00061mix of four integrated uses - Architecture Center, regional Visitor
2011S01406 M00062Center, boutique hotel and event conference space - in the Towers
2011S01406 M00063building and two flanking former wards. This development will utilize
2011S01406 M00064one third of the total historic buildings.
2011S01406 M00065
2011S01406 M00066Three future phases advance complementary arts/cultural uses and
2011S01406 M00067Buffalo State College academic programs. The remaining historic
2011S01406 M00068buildings will be stabilized and mothballed pending these future
2011S01406 M00069uses. The north and northwest portion of the site will be
2011S01406 M00070substantially devoted to landscape but economic circumstances may
2011S01406 M00071result in some future development. Any new development will continue
2011S01406 M00072to provide major landscaped open space and complement the historic
2011S01406 M00073buildings in form and use.
2011S01406 M00074
2011S01406 M00075The Richardson Olmsted site has tremendous potential to improve the
2011S01406 M00076surrounding neighborhoods and benefit Buffalo's economy. The
2011S01406 M00077rehabilitation of this currently vacant series of buildings and vast
2011S01406 M00078grounds will be a catalyst for neighborhood and regional improvement.
2011S01406 M00079New uses will brine activity and investment to the site. The improved
2011S01406 M00080landscape will serve both the new uses and be available as a public
2011S01406 M00081amenity to the neighbors, Buffalo State College, and the Buffalo
2011S01406 M00082Psychiatric Center.

2011S01407 M00017SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01407 M00018
2011S01407 M00019Section one amends the definition of criminal use of a firearm in the
2011S01407 M00020first degree to include displaying a firearm in the commission of any
2011S01407 M00021felony as opposed to just class B violent felonies.
2011S01407 M00022
2011S01407 M00023Section two repeals criminal use of a firearm in the second degree (a
2011S01407 M00024class C felony), this effectively upgrades all instances of criminal
2011S01407 M00025use of a firearm to class B violent felonies.
2011S01407 M00026
2011S01407 M00027Section three is technical and updates the cross references in law.
2011S01407 M00028
2011S01407 M00029JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01407 M00030
2011S01407 M00031The use of firearms to commit violent crimes and terrorize the general
2011S01407 M00032populace is barbaric and unacceptable in any advanced civilization.
2011S01407 M00033However, citizens of the United States of America have a
2011S01407 M00034Constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear arms for their own
2011S01407 M00035purposes including hunting, recreation, collecting, self defense, to
2011S01407 M00036protect their families, to protect their homes or any other lawful
2011S01407 M00037purpose that the individual citizen may desire. These rights have
2011S01407 M00038been recently upheld in the Supreme Court cases of District of
2011S01407 M00039Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago.
2011S01407 M00040
2011S01407 M00041Nonetheless, for a free society to flourish there has to be a
2011S01407 M00042respected rule of law. Hence, it is essential that people who use
2011S01407 M00043force to terrorize and prey upon others be punished to the fullest
2011S01407 M00044extent of the law, and that the laws be strong enough to make use a
2011S01407 M00045firearm in the commission of a crime unthinkable.

2011S01408 M00009facility
2011S01408 M00010
2011S01408 M00011PURPOSE:
2011S01408 M00012
2011S01408 M00013To ensure that minors in correctional facilities have access to the
2011S01408 M00014Hepatitis B vaccine.
2011S01408 M00015
2011S01408 M00016SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01408 M00017
2011S01408 M00018This bill creates a new section 2504-a in the public health law that
2011S01408 M00019would allow a health care practitioner to administer the hepatitis B
2011S01408 M00020vaccine to a person who resides in a state or local correctional
2011S01408 M00021facility and is under the age of 18 without the consent or knowledge
2011S01408 M00022of the parent or guardian of that person, if that person has the
2011S01408 M00023capacity to consent and consents to the immunization. This
2011S01408 M00024legislation defines "health care practitioner" and "capacity to
2011S01408 M00025consent" for the purposes of this section.
2011S01408 M00026
2011S01408 M00027EXISTING LAW:
2011S01408 M00028
2011S01408 M00029Public Health Law section 2305 provides for exceptions to parental
2011S01408 M00030consent for treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) to
2011S01408 M00031minors.
2011S01408 M00032
2011S01408 M00033JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01408 M00034
2011S01408 M00035As noted above, public health law section 2305 provides for exceptions
2011S01408 M00036to parental consent for treatment of sexually transmitted diseases
2011S01408 M00037
2011S01408 M00038(STDs) to minors because minors are often reluctant to seek parental
2011S01408 M00039consent, thereby disclosing to their parents that they have been
2011S01408 M00040sexually active. Without this exception, many STDs would go
2011S01408 M00041untreated. The same exception should apply to immunization against
2011S01408 M00042hepatitis B, because high-risk sexual behavior and intravenous drug
2011S01408 M00043use are recognized as the primary models of hepatitis B transmission.
2011S01408 M00044
2011S01408 M00045The change proposed in this bill is specific to correctional settings
2011S01408 M00046where attempts to obtain parental consent have not yielded results
2011S01408 M00047and many adolescents are left unprotected from this communicable
2011S01408 M00048disease. In 2003 the Centers for Disease control issued a report that
2011S01408 M00049strongly recommended that "all juveniles who receive a medical
2011S01408 M00050evaluation in a correctional facility should be administered the
2011S01408 M00051hepatitis B vaccine, unless they have proof of completion of the
2011S01408 M00052
2011S01408 M00053vaccine series or serologic evidence of immunity to infection. The
2011S01408 M00054vaccine series should be started for those juveniles who have never
2011S01408 M00055been vaccinated, irrespective of
2011S01408 M00056their length of stay, and the series should be completed for those
2011S01408 M00057incompetently immunized."
2011S01408 M00058
2011S01408 M00059To make a minor's immunization contingent on parental consent clearly
2011S01408 M00060hampers efforts to control the spread of the disease, which was
2011S01408 M00061previously recognized and addressed in State law for STDs. Allowing
2011S01408 M00062administration of hepatitis vaccine without parental consent is
2011S01408 M00063already law in several states.

2011S01409 M00006collected on a real property transfer form
2011S01409 M00007
2011S01409 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S01409 M00009This legislation would change the Real Property Law to make
2011S01409 M00010available necessary information including names and addresses of
2011S01409 M00011members of limited liability corporations to local municipalities to
2011S01409 M00012assist them in their efforts to enforce codes, properly administer
2011S01409 M00013the assessment process and collect judgments and taxes.
2011S01409 M00014
2011S01409 M00015SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01409 M00016Section 1 amends subparagraph 7 and 8 of subparagraph ii of
2011S01409 M00017subdivision 1-e of section 333 of the real property law, as amended
2011S01409 M00018by section 1 of part B of Chapter 57 of the laws of
2011S01409 M000192004 and adds two new subparagraphs 9 and 10 to require that a
2011S01409 M00020purchaser of a parcel, in the event it is a limited liability
2011S01409 M00021company, corporation or other such entity, must include the name of a
2011S01409 M00022company, the place of business of the company, the name of a
2011S01409 M00023responsible party who has an interest in the company, and a telephone
2011S01409 M00024number where such responsible party may be contacted.
2011S01409 M00025
2011S01409 M00026Such requirements would apply to all counties in New York State,
2011S01409 M00027including those comprising New York City.
2011S01409 M00028
2011S01409 M00029EXISTING LAW:
2011S01409 M00030Existing law does not require that
2011S01409 M00031member(s) of a LLC
2011S01409 M00032execute articles of organization, specify actual place of business,
2011S01409 M00033or that the members of such LLC be listed.
2011S01409 M00034
2011S01409 M00035JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01409 M00036Residential properties are routinely acquired by
2011S01409 M00037Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) and often the buyer's signature on
2011S01409 M00038the real property transfer form (RP-5217) is illegible, with a post
2011S01409 M00039office box provided for the address. Current law does not require
2011S01409 M00040that members of a LLC or the LLC's actual place of business be listed
2011S01409 M00041on such forms.
2011S01409 M00042
2011S01409 M00043As a result of these oversights in the current Real Property law,
2011S01409 M00044serious problems frequently arise for municipal code enforcement and
2011S01409 M00045assessment officials in carrying out the enforcement of the housing
2011S01409 M00046code, collection of fines and judgments, and delinquent tax
2011S01409 M00047collection. This inability to contact or provide legal service of
2011S01409 M00048notices to an individual responsible for the property seriously
2011S01409 M00049affects the quality of life in neighborhoods with multiple properties
2011S01409 M00050owned by LLC's.

2011S01410 M00006certain employee benefits
2011S01410 M00007
2011S01410 M00008SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01410 M00009This bill adds a new Article 3 to the Elder
2011S01410 M00010Law to prohibit the diminution of the health care benefits of retired
2011S01410 M00011employees after they have retired, making any such diminution null
2011S01410 M00012and void as against state policy.
2011S01410 M00013
2011S01410 M00014JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01410 M00015This measure requires that if an employer has made an agreement
2011S01410 M00016concerning health benefits for an employee, and the employee is
2011S01410 M00017retired and receiving benefits, the employer cannot then later
2011S01410 M00018unilaterally reduce the benefits.
2011S01410 M00019
2011S01410 M00020This measure is much needed. Some employers, looking for areas in
2011S01410 M00021which to save money, have begun to reduce the health benefits to
2011S01410 M00022retired workers-the ones not represented at the bargaining table or
2011S01410 M00023employed as current employees.

2011S01411 M00012
2011S01411 M00013SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01411 M00014Section 1 amends the Penal Law by adding a new subdivision 4-a to
2011S01411 M00015provide that theft of credit card and debit card numbers with the
2011S01411 M00016intent of unlawful use is included within the definition of grand
2011S01411 M00017larceny in the fourth degree.
2011S01411 M00018
2011S01411 M00019Section 2 provides for an effective date of November first after
2011S01411 M00020enactment.
2011S01411 M00021
2011S01411 M00022EXISTING LAW:
2011S01411 M00023Section 155.30 of the Penal Law provides that theft of credit or debit
2011S01411 M00024cards is grand larceny in the fourth degree, however, the law is
2011S01411 M00025silent with regard to theft of credit or debit card numbers.
2011S01411 M00026
2011S01411 M00027JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01411 M00028While it is an E felony to steal property consisting of a credit card
2011S01411 M00029or debit card, if a thief steals a credit card account number or a
2011S01411 M00030debit card account number instead of the actual, physical card, no
2011S01411 M00031crime has been committed until the thief actually uses the account
2011S01411 M00032number and obtains goods, money or services. Previously, in order to
2011S01411 M00033use a stolen credit or debit card, a person would need to physically
2011S01411 M00034possess the card. Now that goods and services can be ordered by phone
2011S01411 M00035or over the Internet, only the card number and not the physical card
2011S01411 M00036is necessary to use the stolen number fraudulently. Stolen card
2011S01411 M00037numbers can also be encoded on plastic to create fraudulent credit or
2011S01411 M00038debit cards.
2011S01411 M00039
2011S01411 M00040Card numbers can be stolen in a variety of ways. In a retail
2011S01411 M00041establishment, a credit or debit card can be entered into a device to
2011S01411 M00042capture account information and then the card is returned to the
2011S01411 M00043customer who is unaware that his account number has been stolen.
2011S01411 M00044Dishonest employees can
2011S01411 M00045copy account numbers from sales receipts or during phone orders and
2011S01411 M00046thieves can steal credit card bills from the mail or hack into
2011S01411 M00047personal computers. Account numbers can also be obtained through
2011S01411 M00048phishing -- sending fraudulent e-mails purporting to be from
2011S01411 M00049legitimate companies that ask for credit card information to be
2011S01411 M00050updated or amended or re-entered by the customer in order to maintain
2011S01411 M00051the business relationship.
2011S01411 M00052
2011S01411 M00053With technological advances proceeding at a rapid pace, criminals are
2011S01411 M00054finding ways to use this new technology before laws can be enacted to
2011S01411 M00055address these types of crimes. This is another step for law
2011S01411 M00056enforcement to use to protect the public from thieves who would steal
2011S01411 M00057their personal account information and run up fraudulent credit card
2011S01411 M00058bills or steal cash through their debit card.

2011S01412 M00016Section one provides that a municipality with a population of 10,000
2011S01412 M00017or less may seek a pro-rated share of the costs for police officer
2011S01412 M00018training expenses, from any law enforcement agency within the State,
2011S01412 M00019when a recently trained police officer is hired by such agency.
2011S01412 M00020
2011S01412 M00021EXISTING LAW:
2011S01412 M00022Current law allows a reimbursement request to be made to a successive
2011S01412 M00023employer, but the scope of potential reimbursement is restricted to
2011S01412 M00024either a municipal corporation or a sheriff that may have hired
2011S01412 M00025someone recently trained by a municipality with a population of less
2011S01412 M00026than 10,000.
2011S01412 M00027
2011S01412 M00028JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01412 M00029The cost of the training of a police officer is a financial investment
2011S01412 M00030that a municipality makes in expectation of some years of service
2011S01412 M00031from the officer. When a recently trained police officer leaves for a
2011S01412 M00032position with a new law enforcement agency, it represents a financial
2011S01412 M00033loss to the municipality who trained that officer. It is especially
2011S01412 M00034costly to small municipalities since the costs represent a larger
2011S01412 M00035percentage of their overall budget. This bill would allow
2011S01412 M00036municipalities with a population of under 10,000 to seek
2011S01412 M00037reimbursement for training expenses from any law enforcement agency
2011S01412 M00038within New York State that might hire a police officer trained within
2011S01412 M00039the last three years.

2011S01412 M00047 FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:
2011S01412 M00048Nominal for the State. This bill represents an expansion of the
2011S01412 M00049opportunity for local governments to secure a reimbursement from any
2011S01412 M00050law enforcement agency that might choose to hire a recently trained
2011S01412 M00051municipal police officer or peace officer. Should a New York State
2011S01412 M00052
2011S01412 M00053law enforcement agency choose to exercise its discretion to hire a
2011S01412 M00054recently trained municipal police officer or peace officer, such an
2011S01412 M00055agency would be responsible to reimburse a pro-rated share of the
2011S01412 M00056cost of training expenses incurred by the former municipal employer.
2011S01412 M00057

2011S01413 M00004An act
2011S01413 M00005to amend the education law, in relation to appointment of
2011S01413 M00006superintendents
2011S01413 M00007
2011S01413 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S01413 M00009To prohibit buyouts of superintendents when contracts are terminated
2011S01413 M00010for just cause. To limit buyouts of superintendents in all other
2011S01413 M00011instances. To require public disclosure by boards of education when
2011S01413 M00012negotiations of buyout agreements are commencing.
2011S01413 M00013
2011S01413 M00014SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01413 M00015Prohibits a board of education from making any payment as compensation
2011S01413 M00016for the remainder of a superintendent's unserved contract when the
2011S01413 M00017termination was for just cause. When the termination was not for
2011S01413 M00018cause, a board of education is authorized to negotiate a compensation
2011S01413 M00019agreement with the superintendent for an amount not in excess of
2011S01413 M00020twenty-five percent of the annual average compensation. Compensation
2011S01413 M00021is defined to mean salary and benefits. Requires the board of
2011S01413 M00022education, at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of
2011S01413 M00023education, to notify the public of the initiation of negotiations.
2011S01413 M00024This bill further specifies the due process procedures to be used to
2011S01413 M00025determine termination for just cause.
2011S01413 M00026
2011S01413 M00027JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01413 M00028At present a school board may remove a superintendent without cause
2011S01413 M00029and provide a significant severance package. In recent years, there
2011S01413 M00030have been at least nine cases across New York State where
2011S01413 M00031superintendents leave positions with large buyouts with little or no
2011S01413 M00032explanation ever provided to the public about the agreed upon terms
2011S01413 M00033and conditions. Two examples highlight this situation, in Middleburgh
2011S01413 M00034Central School District a superintendent was offered nearly $32,000
2011S01413 M00035for unused vacation days, and in the City of Poughkeepsie its
2011S01413 M00036superintendent was likewise offered a buyout that included his full
2011S01413 M00037$163,500 annual salary including benefits for longer than one year.
2011S01413 M00038
2011S01413 M00039This bill prohibits a superintendent from receiving a severance
2011S01413 M00040package when termination was for just cause. In all other instances,
2011S01413 M00041this bill prohibits a superintendent from receiving a severance
2011S01413 M00042package in excess of twenty-five percent of the annual average
2011S01413 M00043compensation.
2011S01413 M00044Additionally, public disclosure by the board of education is required
2011S01413 M00045to notify taxpayers that negotiations for a severance package are
2011S01413 M00046commencing.
2011S01413 M00047
2011S01413 M00048By severely limiting buyouts and removing the secrecy that surrounds
2011S01413 M00049buyouts, this policy gives the public greater assurance that their
2011S01413 M00050taxpayer dollars are being used appropriately.

2011S01414 M00008
2011S01414 M00009PURPOSE:
2011S01414 M00010The bill will help protect more victims of domestic violence by
2011S01414 M00011expanding criminal procedure law section 510.30. The bill will
2011S01414 M00012require the court, when determining recognizance or bail in cases of
2011S01414 M00013domestic violence, to consider certain enumerated factors which could
2011S01414 M00014lead to intimidation or injury by the principal to the victim or
2011S01414 M00015witness.
2011S01414 M00016
2011S01414 M00017SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01414 M00018Section one re-letters paragraph (b) as paragraph (c) of subdivision 2
2011S01414 M00019of section 510.30 of the criminal procedure law and adds a new
2011S01414 M00020paragraph (b). This new paragraph requires the court to consider
2011S01414 M00021certain factors when determining recognizance or bail in cases of
2011S01414 M00022domestic violence such as prior acts of violence or threats of
2011S01414 M00023violence, prior orders of protection, prior arrests or convictions
2011S01414 M00024for offenses against family or household members or intimate or
2011S01414 M00025formerly intimate partners, prior violations of orders of protection,
2011S01414 M00026and access to firearms or a history of firearm use.

2011S01414 M00030
2011S01414 M00031JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01414 M00032Domestic violence is a societal problem of enormous prevalence and
2011S01414 M00033impact. It has been identified by the Surgeon General of the United
2011S01414 M00034States as the number one health problem affecting American women, and
2011S01414 M00035it floods the justice system of New York State as well as the courts
2011S01414 M00036of every other state in the nation.
2011S01414 M00037
2011S01414 M00038New York State has been in the forefront of addressing this problem by
2011S01414 M00039passing many progressive laws over the past few decades, including
2011S01414 M00040the mandatory arrest law, the law creating the registry of orders of
2011S01414 M00041protection, an anti-stalking law, and a law requiring judges to
2011S01414 M00042consider evidence of domestic violence in all child custody and
2011S01414 M00043visitation cases. However, one important
2011S01414 M00044area of the law has not been updated to take into account the unique
2011S01414 M00045nature of domestic violence offenses: New York's bail provisions.
2011S01414 M00046
2011S01414 M00047As a result, perpetrators of domestic violence offenses are often set
2011S01414 M00048free on low or no bail and thereby allowed to stalk, harm and
2011S01414 M00049sometimes kill their specifically targeted victims. In December 2002,
2011S01414 M00050a perpetrator of domestic violence was released on $1,500 bail by a
2011S01414 M00051city judge in Westchester County after an attempted assault with a
2011S01414 M00052
2011S01414 M00053gun on his former girlfriend. Within days after his release on bail,
2011S01414 M00054the perpetrator shot his former girlfriend in the head and killed
2011S01414 M00055himself. As recently as July 2010, a similar tragic incident occurred
2011S01414 M00056in Dutchess County when the perpetrator killed his wife before
2011S01414 M00057turning the gun on himself. This incident occurred only days after
2011S01414 M00058his release on bail, following one month in jail stemming from an
2011S01414 M00059incident of domestic violence.
2011S01414 M00060
2011S01414 M00061If judges determining recognizance and bail in domestic violence cases
2011S01414 M00062were required to consider well established risk factors to the victim
2011S01414 M00063such as a history of violence or threats of violence, prior orders of
2011S01414 M00064protection, and the accused's access to guns, many victims and their
2011S01414 M00065children would be spared additional harm and, in some tragic
2011S01414 M00066incidences, their lives.
2011S01414 M00067
2011S01414 M00068The bail statute currently does not consider the unique nature of
2011S01414 M00069domestic violence cases. The criminal who commits a street crime
2011S01414 M00070against a stranger, for example, is not likely to target the victim
2011S01414 M00071for additional criminal activity while the case is pending and
2011S01414 M00072afterwards. Precisely the reverse is true for domestic violence
2011S01414 M00073perpetrators, who are highly likely to do so. Those who commit acts
2011S01414 M00074of domestic violence do so to exercise power and control over their
2011S01414 M00075specific victim, with whom they have a relationship. Domestic
2011S01414 M00076violence has a high rate of recidivism, and tends to escalate in
2011S01414 M00077frequency and severity over time. The initiation of a court case
2011S01414 M00078against the perpetrator is a high-risk time for the victim, who is
2011S01414 M00079perceived by the abuser as trying to escape the relationship.
2011S01414 M00080Perpetrators often threaten and harm their victims during the
2011S01414 M00081pendency of the case in order to force them not to cooperate with the
2011S01414 M00082prosecution and to reconcile.
2011S01414 M00083
2011S01414 M00084New York law does not allow the bail determination to be used for
2011S01414 M00085"preventive detention," in order to protect the public from a
2011S01414 M00086generalized threat of further criminal activity by an accused.
2011S01414 M00087However, New York law does permit the bail determination to be used
2011S01414 M00088when necessary to protect witnesses to the crime. Domestic violence
2011S01414 M00089cases fall squarely within this rule because the victim of the
2011S01414 M00090offense is the key and some- time the only witness and, as noted
2011S01414 M00091above, is highly likely to be targeted by the perpetrator for further
2011S01414 M00092threats or harm. Thus, in domestic violence cases, it is essential
2011S01414 M00093that the judge determining recognizance or bail consider factors that
2011S01414 M00094indicate a risk of harm to the victim-witness. This bill offers
2011S01414 M00095guidance to judges by specifying factors including prior acts of
2011S01414 M00096violence or threats of violence, prior orders of protection, prior
2011S01414 M00097arrests or convictions for offenses against intimates or family
2011S01414 M00098members, prior violations of orders of protection, and access to
2011S01414 M00099firearms.

2011S01414 M00100
2011S01414 M00101This bill is drafted to include intimate partners and former intimate
2011S01414 M00102partners as well as those who fall within the Criminal Procedure
2011S01414 M00103Law's definition of members of the same family or household, This
2011S01414 M00104broad definition is critical because so many victims of domestic
2011S01414 M00105
2011S01414 M00106violence never married or had a child in common with the perpetrator
2011S01414 M00107and thus would not meet the current definition.
2011S01414 M00108Based on the Final Report to the Governor and the Legislature,
2011S01414 M00109Evaluation of the Mandatory Arrest Provisions (January 2001), it can
2011S01414 M00110be estimated that almost half of the victims of domestic offenses do
2011S01414 M00111not meet the current definition.
2011S01414 M00112
2011S01414 M00113Bail reform must help these victims as well. Bail reform is necessary
2011S01414 M00114to protect the victim witness of domestic offenses. Current bail
2011S01414 M00115provisions must be updated to reflect the reality of the lives of
2011S01414 M00116domestic violence victims.

2011S01415 M00030patronizes a prostitute who is a child under 15 years of age is
2011S01415 M00031guilty of a class D felony.
2011S01415 M00032
2011S01415 M00033Section 4 amends section 230.06 of the Penal Law, as added by Chapter
2011S01415 M00034627 of the Laws of 1978, by defining patronizing a prostitute in the
2011S01415 M00035first degree. It provides that a person patronizing a prostitute who
2011S01415 M00036is a child under 11 years of age, or a person who is 18 years of age
2011S01415 M00037or older, and patronizes a prostitute who is a child under the age of
2011S01415 M0003813 is guilty of a class C felony.

2011S01415 M00041
2011S01415 M00042Section 6 amends section 230.25 of the Penal Law, as added by Chapter
2011S01415 M00043627 of the Laws of 1978, by defining promoting prostitution in the
2011S01415 M00044third degree. It provides that promoting a prostitute under the age
2011S01415 M00045of 17 years old is a class D felony.
2011S01415 M00046
2011S01415 M00047Section 7 amends section 230.30 of the Penal Law, as added by Chapter

2011S01415 M00049second degree. It provides that promoting a prostitute under the age
2011S01415 M00050of 15 years old is a class C felony.
2011S01415 M00051
2011S01415 M00052Section 8 amends section 230.32 of the Penal Law, as added by Chapter
2011S01415 M00053627 of the Laws of 1978, by defining promoting prostitution in the
2011S01415 M00054first degree. It provides that promoting a prostitute under the age
2011S01415 M00055of 13 years old is a class B felony.
2011S01415 M00056
2011S01415 M00057Section 9 amends section 230.33 of the Penal Law, as added by Chapter
2011S01415 M00058450 of the Laws of 2005, by amending the definition of compelling
2011S01415 M00059prostitution. It provides that compelling a child under the age of 17
2011S01415 M00060years old to engage in prostitution is a is a class B felony.
2011S01415 M00061
2011S01415 M00062Section 10 sets forth the effective date as the ninetieth day after it
2011S01415 M00063shall have become law.
2011S01415 M00064
2011S01415 M00065EXISTING LAW:
2011S01415 M00066Currently, engaging in sex with a child under the age of 15 is
2011S01415 M00067ordinarily a class D felony, but patronizing a prostitute who is
2011S01415 M00068under the age of 14 is a class E non-violent felony. Throughout New
2011S01415 M00069York State's sex crimes statutes, a child is considered to be a
2011S01415 M00070person under the age of 17, but the crime of compelling prostitution
2011S01415 M00071applies to victims who are less than 16. A defendant who pays for sex
2011S01415 M00072with a ten year old child would be charged with patronizing a
2011S01415 M00073prostitute in the first degree, a class D felony, but if no money is
2011S01415 M00074exchanged or offered, that same defendant would be charged with
2011S01415 M00075first-degree rape, a class B violent felony.
2011S01415 M00076
2011S01415 M00077JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01415 M00078There are multiple inconsistencies throughout Penal Law with regard to
2011S01415 M00079the ages of victims of crimes of prostitution and certain other sex
2011S01415 M00080crimes involving children. This bill would raise the penalty for
2011S01415 M00081patronizing a prostitute in the first degree to a class C felony, and
2011S01415 M00082adjust certain other patronizing and promoting crimes. While there
2011S01415 M00083is, currently, strict liability imposed upon defendants who have sex
2011S01415 M00084with children, this legislation would apply the same standard of
2011S01415 M00085liability to defendants who have sex with child prostitutes.

2011S01416 M00004An act
2011S01416 M00005to amend the penal law and the correction law,
2011S01416 M00006in relation to establishing penalties for
2011S01416 M00007failure to provide a DNA sample and failure to register or verify

2011S01416 M00009offender
2011S01416 M00010
2011S01416 M00011PURPOSE:
2011S01416 M00012To create criminal penalties in two instances: where a convicted sex
2011S01416 M00013offender fails to meet his or her obligation under to Sex Offender
2011S01416 M00014Registration Act (SORA); and where a convicted offender refuses or
2011S01416 M00015fails to provide a DNA sample as provided by sections 995(7) and
2011S01416 M00016995-c(3) of the Executive Law.
2011S01416 M00017
2011S01416 M00018SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01416 M00019Section 1 amends the Penal Law by adding two new sections 195.01 and
2011S01416 M00020195.02 providing that a person who is required under law to provide a
2011S01416 M00021DNA sample must do so within 30 days or face misdemeanor charges for
2011S01416 M00022the first offense or an E felony for a second and subsequent offense.
2011S01416 M00023
2011S01416 M00024Section 2 amends the Penal Law by adding two new sections 195.03 and
2011S01416 M00025195.04 providing that a person who is required under law to register
2011S01416 M00026as a sex offender, and who fails to do so, may be charged with a
2011S01416 M00027class E felony upon the first offense, and a class D felony upon
2011S01416 M00028subsequent offenses.
2011S01416 M00029
2011S01416 M00030Section 3 amends section 168-t of the Corrections Law to clarify that
2011S01416 M00031the failure of a sex offender to register or verify may be considered
2011S01416 M00032for a violation of parole or probation.
2011S01416 M00033
2011S01416 M00034Section 4 provides the effective date, which is the first of November
2011S01416 M00035next succeeding the date on which it shall have become law.
2011S01416 M00036
2011S01416 M00037EXISTING LAW:
2011S01416 M00038Currently, a convicted sex offender who fails to register or verify
2011S01416 M00039his or her information as required under SORA may be charged with a
2011S01416 M00040crime under section 168-t of the correction law. A first time offense
2011S01416 M00041is a class E felony and any subsequent offense is a class D felony.
2011S01416 M00042There is no
2011S01416 M00043penalty provided, specifically, for failure or refusal to provide a
2011S01416 M00044DNA sample and many convicted offenders flout their obligation.
2011S01416 M00045
2011S01416 M00046JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01416 M00047The Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) was an important initiative
2011S01416 M00048in the pursuit to keep our communities safe. However, because failure
2011S01416 M00049to register is a Correction Law felony and not a Penal Law felony, it
2011S01416 M00050does not constitute a predicate felony with regard to enhanced
2011S01416 M00051sentencing.
2011S01416 M00052
2011S01416 M00053Moving the offense of "failure to register" to the Penal Law would
2011S01416 M00054improve compliance with the important public safety initiative of
2011S01416 M00055SORA by making offenders who repeatedly refuse to comply with their
2011S01416 M00056sex offender obligations subject to enhanced sentences.
2011S01416 M00057
2011S01416 M00058Under Executive Law sections 995(7) and 995-c(3), certain crimes
2011S01416 M00059require the convicted to provide a DNA sample. The success of New
2011S01416 M00060York State's DNA data bank depends on it being as complete as
2011S01416 M00061possible. Nevertheless, many convicted criminals continue to flout
2011S01416 M00062the law and refuse to comply. Offenders are occasionally charged with
2011S01416 M00063obstructing governmental administration in the second degree (section
2011S01416 M00064195.05 of the Penal Law), though this was not the original intent of
2011S01416 M00065section 195.05. Several states have addressed this problem with
2011S01416 M00066statutes that provide a misdemeanor penalty or fines. Creating a
2011S01416 M00067misdemeanor offense in New York for failure to provide a DNA sample
2011S01416 M00068would provide an incentive to comply with the current law.

2011S01417 M00023years of age.
2011S01417 M00024
2011S01417 M00025Section three amends section 263.11 of the Penal Law creating the
2011S01417 M00026crime of possessing an obscene sexual performance by a child in the
2011S01417 M00027third degree as a class E felony when an individual knowingly
2011S01417 M00028possesses or has in their control any obscene performance including
2011S01417 M00029sexual conduct involving a child less than sixteen years of age.
2011S01417 M00030
2011S01417 M00031Section four amends the Penal Law adding two new sections, 263.12 and
2011S01417 M00032263.13 to create the crime of possessing an obscene sexual
2011S01417 M00033performance by a child in the second degree when the individual
2011S01417 M00034knowingly possesses or controls twenty-five (25) or more obscene

2011S01417 M00041less than sixteen. This is a class C felony.
2011S01417 M00042
2011S01417 M00043Section five amends Section 263.15 of the Penal Law creating a crime
2011S01417 M00044of promoting a sexual performance by a child in the second degree
2011S01417 M00045when knowing the character and content, an individual produces,

2011S01417 M00048
2011S01417 M00049Section six amends the Penal Law to add section 263.14 to create the
2011S01417 M00050crime of promoting a sexual performance by a child in the first
2011S01417 M00051degree when knowingly produces, directs or promotes twenty-five (25)

2011S01417 M00082
2011S01417 M00083JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01417 M00084This bill responds to the increasing misuse of the internet as a
2011S01417 M00085medium for the sexual exploitation and abuse of children. A recent
2011S01417 M00086study by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children
2011S01417 M00087reports that 1 in 4 children were subjected to unwanted exposure to
2011S01417 M00088pictures of nude individuals or people having sex on the internet.
2011S01417 M00089Child pornography is a particular threat, as it not only victimizes
2011S01417 M00090the children used in the production or pictures, but creates a ripple
2011S01417 M00091effect in the victimization of further children. Child abuse experts
2011S01417 M00092have documented the common tendency of pedophiles to lower potential
2011S01417 M00093victims' inhibitions by exposing them to images of other children
2011S01417 M00094engaging in sexual activity.
2011S01417 M00095
2011S01417 M00096No level of child pornography is harmless and the current statutory
2011S01417 M00097scheme reflects that insight.
2011S01417 M00098However, the unintended consequence of a "one size fits all" statutory
2011S01417 M00099scheme lends itself to unwarranted leniency for child pornographers

2011S01417 M00100overall. The high-volume dealer may escape criminal liability
2011S01417 M00101proportionate to the crime, both through a low top felony count and
2011S01417 M00102through the frequent conflation of multiple counts at sentencing.
2011S01417 M00103
2011S01417 M00104A statutory amendment to provide for graded child pornography offenses
2011S01417 M00105is urgently required to assist law enforcement in the face of
2011S01417 M00106evolving technology. Over the past decade, explosive growth in disk
2011S01417 M00107storage capacity has facilitated the development of massive
2011S01417 M00108collections of child pornography, while evolving internet
2011S01417 M00109communication technology has enabled collection owners to organize
2011S01417 M00110sophisticated trade or profit-based mechanisms for distribution.
2011S01417 M00111
2011S01417 M00112A graduated scheme of child pornography offenses is consistent with
2011S01417 M00113other New York statutes governing the distribution and possession of
2011S01417 M00114contraband. In the area of narcotics and possession of stolen
2011S01417 M00115property, for example, the state statutes are graded to reflect the
2011S01417 M00116insight that kingpins and mid-level operatives generally pose a
2011S01417 M00117greater threat to society than street-level criminals.

2011S01417 M00119A graduated scheme of state statutes governing child pornography would
2011S01417 M00120also be in harmony with the effect of federal procedures in this
2011S01417 M00121area. Federal sentencing procedure in the field of child pornography
2011S01417 M00122approximates the effect of a graded statutory scheme via sentencing
2011S01417 M00123enhancements applied, for example, to the possession of greater than
2011S01417 M00124ten images of child pornography.

2011S01418 M00004An act
2011S01418 M00005to amend the correction law, in relation to permissible employment,
2011S01418 M00006employment related activities, and volunteer activities that may be
2011S01418 M00007performed by convicted sex offenders
2011S01418 M00008
2011S01418 M00009PURPOSE:
2011S01418 M00010This bill amends certain sections of the correction law with
2011S01418 M00011respect to the employment of convicted sex offenders.
2011S01418 M00012
2011S01418 M00013SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01418 M00014Section 1 amends the Correction Law by prohibiting convicted sex
2011S01418 M00015offenders from working or volunteering at any facility where such
2011S01418 M00016employment would allow the offender unsupervised access to
2011S01418 M00017residential living quarters.
2011S01418 M00018Section 2 establishes an immediate effective date.
2011S01418 M00019
2011S01418 M00020JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01418 M00021The enactment of the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) (Correction
2011S01418 M00022Law Article 6-C) in 1996 established a system within which to
2011S01418 M00023protect our communities by requiring sex offenders to register with
2011S01418 M00024the State, and to make public information about offenders living in
2011S01418 M00025our neighborhoods. Armed with this information, our communities are
2011S01418 M00026able to shield the most vulnerable of citizens. While current law
2011S01418 M00027provides comprehensive residential prohibitions, it lacks similar
2011S01418 M00028employment restrictions. The law goes to great lengths to restrict
2011S01418 M00029convicted sex offenders from living in our neighborhoods, yet allows
2011S01418 M00030convicted offenders to work in our homes without our knowledge or
2011S01418 M00031supervision.
2011S01418 M00032
2011S01418 M00033This loophole was recently highlighted in the news when it was
2011S01418 M00034discovered that a Level-3 sex offender was employed as a
2011S01418 M00035superintendent in a residential building in Manhattan. Employment as
2011S01418 M00036a building superintendent allowed this convicted offender to possess
2011S01418 M00037keys to individual apartments. Permitting convicted sex offenders
2011S01418 M00038such unsupervised access is dangerous, and counter-intuitive. Most
2011S01418 M00039shocking about this unfettered access to residences, is that the
2011S01418 M00040existing law does not prohibit convicted sex offenders from obtaining
2011S01418 M00041such employment.
2011S01418 M00042
2011S01418 M00043Amending Section 168-v of the Correction Law expands and enhances the
2011S01418 M00044protections established by the Sex Offender Registration Act. This
2011S01418 M00045amendment is not intended to bar one's ability to secure a
2011S01418 M00046livelihood, but to exclude from permissible employment those
2011S01418 M00047positions in which convicted sex offenders have unsupervised access
2011S01418 M00048to residences. Requiring direct supervision of any convicted sex
2011S01418 M00049offender employee, or volunteer, who has access to residential living
2011S01418 M00050quarters is not only prudent, but necessary to protect our most
2011S01418 M00051vulnerable citizens.

2011S01419 M00015
2011S01419 M00016SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01419 M00017Section 1 amends Subdivision 5 of Section 514 of the Vehicle and
2011S01419 M00018Traffic Law directing the trial court or clerk to, upon conviction
2011S01419 M00019for a violation of the vehicle and traffic law, inform the parent or
2011S01419 M00020guardian of their right to submit a form to DMV which allows them to
2011S01419 M00021withdraw consent for the issuance or reissuance of a driver's license
2011S01419 M00022or learner's permit.
2011S01419 M00023
2011S01419 M00024Section 2 makes the effective date nine months after it becomes law.
2011S01419 M00025
2011S01419 M00026EXISTING LAW:
2011S01419 M00027Subdivision 2 of Section 502 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law requires
2011S01419 M00028that an applicant for a class DJ or MJ license must submit written
2011S01419 M00029consent to the issuance of such license by the applicant's parent or
2011S01419 M00030guardian. Upon receipt of withdrawal of such consent, any class DJ or
2011S01419 M00031MJ license, learner's permit or license application shall be canceled.
2011S01419 M00032
2011S01419 M00033JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01419 M00034Many parents are aware that they must sign a written consent form in
2011S01419 M00035order for their child to secure a junior driver's license, however,
2011S01419 M00036most parents are not aware that they may withdraw such consent at any
2011S01419 M00037time while their child holds a learner's permit or junior license
2011S01419 M00038simply by filling out a withdrawal of consent form with the
2011S01419 M00039Department of Motor Vehicles. When a junior driver is convicted of a
2011S01419 M00040serious traffic violation, it is critically important that parents
2011S01419 M00041and guardians are made well aware that they may withdraw consent,
2011S01419 M00042thus canceling their child's driving application.
2011S01419 M00043
2011S01419 M00044Being convicted of a serious traffic violation as a holder of
2011S01419 M00045learner's permit or junior license may indicate a lack of experience,
2011S01419 M00046maturity or ability. Parents and guardians who are made aware of the
2011S01419 M00047law allowing them to withdraw consent may choose to exercise this
2011S01419 M00048right. Young drivers are those who are statistically most likely to
2011S01419 M00049be involved in motor vehicle accidents and as such, this notification
2011S01419 M00050may serve to reduce the number of accidents and curb teenage reckless
2011S01419 M00051driving.

2011S01420 M00004An act
2011S01420 M00005to amend the real property tax law, in relation to providing a rent
2011S01420 M00006increase exemption to persons with disabilities
2011S01420 M00007
2011S01420 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S01420 M00009To simplify the application process for the Disability Rent Increase
2011S01420 M00010Exemption (DRIB) program by providing for an income limit similar to
2011S01420 M00011that currently used for the Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption
2011S01420 M00012(SCRIE) program.
2011S01420 M00013
2011S01420 M00014SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01420 M00015Amends §467-b and §467-c of the Real Property Tax law to provide
2011S01420 M00016that tile DRIE income limit for persons who receive either Social
2011S01420 M00017Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or disability related Medicaid
2011S01420 M00018is the same as the income limit for SCRIE applicants.
2011S01420 M00019
2011S01420 M00020Additional amendments to sections 467-15 and 467-c of Real Property
2011S01420 M00021Tax law provide that the DRIB eligibility criteria for disabled
2011S01420 M00022veterans is the same as that currently provided for Supplemental
2011S01420 M00023Security Income (SSI) recipients. The bill specifies that disabled
2011S01420 M00024veterans are eligible for tile DRIE program if they meet the other
2011S01420 M00025criteria for eligibility (must live in a rent regulated apartment and
2011S01420 M00026pay one-third or more of their income for rent).
2011S01420 M00027
2011S01420 M00028JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01420 M00029In 2005, the Legislature acted to expand the SCRIE program to disabled
2011S01420 M00030New Yorkers. SCRIE freezes rents for seniors living in rent-regulated
2011S01420 M00031housing with incomes below $25,000 per year who pay one-third or more
2011S01420 M00032of their income for rent. Landlords are compensated for the full
2011S01420 M00033amount of the foregone rent through refundable real property tax
2011S01420 M00034abatements.
2011S01420 M00035Starting October 10,2005, disabled New Yorkers became eligible for the
2011S01420 M00036new benefit, commonly referred to as DRIE. The DRIB program is
2011S01420 M00037designed to work the same way as SCRIE, however the income limits for
2011S01420 M00038DRIE vary making it difficult for consumers to know if they. meet the
2011S01420 M00039eligibility criteria.
2011S01420 M00040
2011S01420 M00041While the SCRIE program uses an income limit regardless of household
2011S01420 M00042size (recently increased to $25,000), the DRIE program income limit
2011S01420 M00043varies depending on household size. In addition, the current DRIE
2011S01420 M00044application process is more complex as applicants must factor in
2011S01420 M00045impairment related work expenses (IRWEs), or blind work expenses
2011S01420 M00046(BWEs) in order to determine their income. Such expenses include
2011S01420 M00047attendant care, transportation, medical devices, prostheses,
2011S01420 M00048work-related equipment and assistants, residential modifications,
2011S01420 M00049medications and medical services, diagnostic procedures, and
2011S01420 M00050non-medical appliances and devices. Under this legislation,
2011S01420 M00051applicants would no longer need to determine these expenses.
2011S01420 M00052
2011S01420 M00053This legislation also simplifies the application process by allowing
2011S01420 M00054disabled veterans, provided they meet any of the eligibility
2011S01420 M00055criteria, to be categorically eligible just as SSI recipients are
2011S01420 M00056now. While 94% of disabled veterans are already eligible for the
2011S01420 M00057program, the remaining 6% that will become eligible by this
2011S01420 M00058legislation are those which are severely disabled and therefore
2011S01420 M00059receive higher disability compensation.

2011S01421 M00075police and reports by the state police to the department of health
2011S01421 M00076shall not constitute libel or slander or a violation of the right of

2011S01421 M00080
2011S01421 M00081Section 2 of the bill amends section 206 of the public health law by
2011S01421 M00082adding a new subdivision 20:
2011S01421 M00083
2011S01421 M00084SAFE IMPORTATION SITES:
2011S01421 M00085Requires the commissioner to establish a registry of web sites and
2011S01421 M00086entities which offer or provide a mechanism to sell prescription
2011S01421 M00087drugs to consumers in New York from another country and shall post
2011S01421 M00088such registry on a health department website dedicated
2011S01421 M00089to providing information for such registry.
2011S01421 M00090Data to be published on such health department website include:
2011S01421 M00091
2011S01421 M00092a) the
2011S01421 M00093name of the website or entity which offers or provides a mechanism to
2011S01421 M00094sell prescription drugs to consumers in New York from another
2011S01421 M00095country,
2011S01421 M00096
2011S01421 M00097b) the number of complaints concerning such website or

2011S01421 M00100c) convictions, if known, of the parties operating the
2011S01421 M00101website, for importing or reimporting prescription drugs which are
2011S01421 M00102adulterated
2011S01421 M00103
2011S01421 M00104or mislabeled or otherwise in violation of section 6811 of the
2011S01421 M00105education law, and
2011S01421 M00106
2011S01421 M00107d) whether the website or entity has permission
2011S01421 M00108from the appropriate federal agency to import or reimport
2011S01421 M00109prescription drugs into this country.
2011S01421 M00110
2011S01421 M00111Finally, the measure provides that good faith reporting or disclosure
2011S01421 M00112by the commissioner pursuant to the requirements of this subsection
2011S01421 M00113shall not constitute libel or slander or a violation of the right of

2011S01421 M00116JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01421 M00117This legislation provides appropriate oversight and protection to the
2011S01421 M00118citizens of New York who are buying or who may be tempted to buy
2011S01421 M00119their prescription drugs over the Internet. As was learned in the
2011S01421 M00120recent hearings on pharmaceutical purchasing, there are many good,
2011S01421 M00121competent providers of the drugs, but there are also unscrupulous
2011S01421 M00122dealers who provide drugs that are adulterated or mislabeled. In one
2011S01421 M00123case, evidence presented at the hearing, showed that drugs supposedly
2011S01421 M00124imported from a Canadian website were actually manufactured in
2011S01421 M00125Pakistan, shipped in adulterated containers, and the package did not
2011S01421 M00126contain the drugs it was supposed to contain.

2011S01422 M00009SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01422 M00010
2011S01422 M00011This bill would amend section 155.35 of the Penal law (grand larceny
2011S01422 M00012in the third degree, a class 0 felony) by including within its
2011S01422 M00013provisions the taking of property, regardless of its nature and
2011S01422 M00014value, from persons sixty-five or older by those more than ten years
2011S01422 M00015younger than the victim. At present, such conduct is punishable
2011S01422 M00016pursuant to Penal Law § 155.30 (grand larceny in the fourth degree, a
2011S01422 M00017class E felony).
2011S01422 M00018
2011S01422 M00019JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01422 M00020
2011S01422 M00021The State Legislature has recently taken strong action to better
2011S01422 M00022protect the senior citizens of New York State by upgrading the crime
2011S01422 M00023of assault to a class D felony when it is committed against a person
2011S01422 M00024who is 65 years of age or older by another person who is more than
2011S01422 M00025ten years younger than the victim. The Legislature is to be commended
2011S01422 M00026for taking this reasonable and necessary step, but the corollary
2011S01422 M00027measure contained in this bill addresses an equally compelling need -
2011S01422 M00028amendment of Penal Law to offer similar protection to elderly victims
2011S01422 M00029of the crime of grand larceny by effectively increasing the penalty
2011S01422 M00030(from a class E to a class D felony) for those who take property from
2011S01422 M00031the person of an elderly victim.
2011S01422 M00032
2011S01422 M00033Last year, there were two particularly heinous attacks on elderly New
2011S01422 M00034Yorkers, which involved attempts to steal property from two elderly
2011S01422 M00035victims. These attacks were properly classified and charged as
2011S01422 M00036assaults, among other crimes. However, there
2011S01422 M00037are other situations where some or all of the elements of the crime of
2011S01422 M00038assault may be absent, making enhanced protection for elderly victims
2011S01422 M00039unavailable. The selection of an elderly person as the victim of a
2011S01422 M00040mugging, even without a demonstrable intent to cause physical injury
2011S01422 M00041on the part of the attacker, compels equal concern. It is necessary
2011S01422 M00042not only to upgrade the penalty for assault, but also for grand
2011S01422 M00043larceny from the person, in order to allow elderly New Yorkers to go
2011S01422 M00044about their business without fear. Where a thief snatches a purse
2011S01422 M00045from the arm of an elderly victim, both physical and psychological
2011S01422 M00046damage ensues, whether or not the damage rises to the level of
2011S01422 M00047"physical injury" required for charging the crime of assault.
2011S01422 M00048Criminals must be placed on notice that the choice of an elderly
2011S01422 M00049victim carries much greater consequences than does targeting a victim
2011S01422 M00050more likely to be able to prevent the theft or defend themselves.

2011S01423 M00014
2011S01423 M00015SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01423 M00016
2011S01423 M00017This bill amends Criminal Procedure Law §§ 160.50(d) and 160.55 (d)
2011S01423 M00018as well as Executive Law Section 296 (16) to allow the disclosure of
2011S01423 M00019criminal histories of all applicants for employment by police
2011S01423 M00020departments and other law enforcement agencies. The amendments to the
2011S01423 M00021Criminal Procedure Law allow for unsealing of criminal histories for
2011S01423 M00022the purpose of investigating applicants for law enforcement
2011S01423 M00023positions. The companion amendment to the Executive Law removes as an
2011S01423 M00024unlawful discriminatory practice under Section 296 (16) inquiries
2011S01423 M00025made by a police department or law enforcement agency regarding the
2011S01423 M00026criminal history of an applicant for a position with such department
2011S01423 M00027or agency.
2011S01423 M00028
2011S01423 M00029JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01423 M00030
2011S01423 M00031It is vitally important that police departments and other law
2011S01423 M00032enforcement agencies have the ability to conduct thorough background
2011S01423 M00033checks on potential employees. Current law provides an ability to do
2011S01423 M00034so when the applicant is a potential police officer or peace officer,
2011S01423 M00035pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 160.50(d). Law enforcement
2011S01423 M00036agencies may in that instance receive criminal histories that include
2011S01423 M00037sealed cases terminated in favor of the accused.
2011S01423 M00038
2011S01423 M00039However, under current law, no such ability exists when the case was
2011S01423 M00040sealed under the provisions of Criminal Procedure Law § 160.55,
2011S01423 M00041after a conviction of a non-criminal offense. This anomalous result,
2011S01423 M00042where law enforcement is authorized to obtain records of sealed
2011S01423 M00043acquittals but not sealed convictions, must be corrected.
2011S01423 M00044
2011S01423 M00045Further, in neither case are the records of potential civilian
2011S01423 M00046employees of law enforcement agencies made available. Employment by a
2011S01423 M00047police agency is by definition sensitive in nature. Civilian
2011S01423 M00048employees may have
2011S01423 M00049access to highly confidential information and, may occupy positions of
2011S01423 M00050trust, with the availability to take enforcement action or make
2011S01423 M00051decisions affecting agency operations and policy. police agencies are
2011S01423 M00052
2011S01423 M00053responsible for both conventional crime fighting and counter
2011S01423 M00054terrorism efforts, and it is vitally important that as much
2011S01423 M00055information be obtained about potential employees as possible, in al
2011S01423 M00056ranks and for all purposes, before a law enforcement agency entrusts
2011S01423 M00057them with responsibility for public safety.

2011S01424 M00014Amends the elder law by adding a new Article IV to read
2011S01424 M00015intergenerational educational and mentoring service program.
2011S01424 M00016Section 301 contains definitions.
2011S01424 M00017Section 302 establishes local intergenerational educational
2011S01424 M00018and mentoring service programs.

2011S01424 M00022
2011S01424 M00023JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01424 M00024Many older New Yorkers who retire do not wish to sit idle. Many are
2011S01424 M00025looking to continue to work in some capacity, or to find volunteer
2011S01424 M00026opportunities that are meaningful. This legislation provides a
2011S01424 M00027mechanism to do a number of things. First, it provides an opportunity
2011S01424 M00028for older adults to work directly with children helping them in
2011S01424 M00029school to increase their ability to learn and by being mentors.
2011S01424 M00030Second, it provides the classrooms with additional help. Third, it
2011S01424 M00031provides children with an opportunity to be close to and learn from
2011S01424 M00032older adults, who have a lifetimes worth of knowledge and experience
2011S01424 M00033and the desire to be engaged with the children in a volunteer
2011S01424 M00034capacity. Fourth, it provides an opportunity for children who may
2011S01424 M00035need extra help or are struggling in schools to gain one-on-one
2011S01424 M00036attention and extra help, providing them with increased self-esteem
2011S01424 M00037and the ability to learn and excel. And finally, bridging the
2011S01424 M00038generations provides a benefit to the older adult and to the child.
2011S01424 M00039The older adult stays connected in the community and less likely to
2011S01424 M00040want to move out of state. The older adult is able to give back to
2011S01424 M00041the community in a meaningful way. The child has exposure to older
2011S01424 M00042people and can learn from them, interact with them and have
2011S01424 M00043a better understanding of being older.

2011S01426 M00015SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01426 M00016Amends Section 593 of the Labor Law to provide
2011S01426 M00017that an employee of a temporary employment service shall be deemed to

2011S01426 M00019not contact the employment firm within five days for reassignment
2011S01426 M00020upon the completion of an assignment. Failure to contact the
2011S01426 M00021temporary employment service shall not be deemed a voluntary

2011S01426 M00030opportunities available through reassignment by the temporary
2011S01426 M00031employment service and subsequently file for unemployment insurance.
2011S01426 M00032This bill will ensure that there is communication between the
2011S01426 M00033temporary employment service and the individual in order to determine

2011S01427 M00004CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
2011S01427 M00005proposing an amendment to the constitution
2011S01427 M00006in relation to the right to keep and
2011S01427 M00007bear arms
2011S01427 M00008
2011S01427 M00009PURPOSE:
2011S01427 M00010This proposed constitutional amendment would provide within
2011S01427 M00011the New York State Constitution for a right of the people to keep and
2011S01427 M00012bear arms for traditionally recognized purposes.
2011S01427 M00013
2011S01427 M00014SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01427 M00015A new Article Twenty would be added to the State Constitution to
2011S01427 M00016ensure the individual right of the law-abiding citizen to keep and
2011S01427 M00017bear arms for the purposes of defense of self, state, hunting and
2011S01427 M00018recreation.
2011S01427 M00019
2011S01427 M00020JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01427 M00021The proposed language is an approximate conglomeration of the language
2011S01427 M00022of the Oregon and New Mexico State constitutions. It seeks to protect
2011S01427 M00023activities involving lawfully held arms, which have been
2011S01427 M00024traditionally recognized by the constitutions of the various states.
2011S01427 M00025The language also places with the State all authority over the
2011S01427 M00026regulation of arms and arms accouterments. This is something of
2011S01427 M00027particularly great need in New York State as a patchwork of local
2011S01427 M00028regulations and administrative practices have created tremendous
2011S01427 M00029confusion over and disparity between, applicable regulations from
2011S01427 M00030county to county.
2011S01427 M00031
2011S01427 M00032In recent years, there has been considerable dispute as to whether the
2011S01427 M00033right of the people to keep and bear arms, (as guaranteed by the
2011S01427 M00034United States Constitution, Amendment II), protects an individual
2011S01427 M00035right to arms, or only state power over militias. Recently, in the
2011S01427 M00036landmark case of D. C. v. Heller the Supreme Court held that the
2011S01427 M00037Second Amendment does in fact protect an individual right to possess
2011S01427 M00038a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes such as self-defense. (D.C.
2011S01427 M00039v. Heller, 554 U.S. 290 (2008)). In reaching this holding, the Court
2011S01427 M00040cited historical scholarship and linguistic evidence which amply
2011S01427 M00041demonstrates that what the Second Amendment to the United States
2011S01427 M00042Constitution guarantees is a right of law-abiding, responsible adults
2011S01427 M00043to acquire and possess arms for lawful uses. (See, e.g. 4
2011S01427 M00044Encyclopedia of the American Constitution, 1639-40, Karst & Levi eds.
2011S01427 M00045(1986); Levinson, The Embarrassing Second Amendment, 99 Yale Law
2011S01427 M00046Journal 637, (1991); Khates, Handgun Prohibition and the Original
2011S01427 M00047Meaning of the Second Amendment, 82 Michigan Law Review 204, 244-52,
2011S01427 M00048(1983); Shalhope, The Ideological Origins of the Second Amendment, 69
2011S01427 M00049Journal of American History 599, (1982)). The Court further cited the
2011S01427 M00050many state constitutions containing provisions protecting an
2011S01427 M00051individual right to bear
2011S01427 M00052
2011S01427 M00053arms for self-defense. (D.C. v. Heller, 554 U.S. 590). Thus, the
2011S01427 M00054amendment proposed puts to a
2011S01427 M00055final rest whatever remains of the now largely discredited states'
2011S01427 M00056rights position. However, as the proposed amendment explicitly
2011S01427 M00057provides for a right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of defense
2011S01427 M00058of the State, it is clear that the ability of the State to maintain
2011S01427 M00059its traditional militia is not in any way impaired by enactment of
2011S01427 M00060the amendment.
2011S01427 M00061
2011S01427 M00062The proposal here is for a guarantee of individual rights in a state
2011S01427 M00063constitution, and this necessarily means that the guarantee is to the
2011S01427 M00064individual rather than the State. Indeed, the State would have no
2011S01427 M00065reason to guarantee rights of the state, possessed under the state
2011S01427 M00066Constitution, against prohibition by the State itself. Civil rights
2011S01427 M00067provisions, such as the proposal here, have been generally
2011S01427 M00068interpreted as broadly guaranteeing a right of individuals to possess
2011S01427 M00069various kinds of ordinary arms to law-abiding, responsible adults.
2011S01427 M00070(See, State v. Kessler, 614 P. 2d 94, (Or.
2011S01427 M00071S.Ct. 1980); see also, S. Halbrook, A Right To Bear Arms: State and
2011S01427 M00072Federal Bills of Right and Constitutional Guarantees 1989); Dowle,
2011S01427 M00073The Right to Arms, 36 Oklahoma Law Review 789 (1982); Dowle, Federal
2011S01427 M00074and State Constitutional Guarantees To Arms. 15 university of Dayton
2011S01427 M00075Law Review 1 1989); Chaplain, The Right of the Individual to Bear
2011S01427 M00076Arms, bet. Coll. Law Review 789 (1982). There is no provision
2011S01427 M00077currently in the New York State constitution providing for a
2011S01427 M00078guarantee of the right to keep and bear arms. This puts New York into
2011S01427 M00079a small minority of states lacking such traditional state
2011S01427 M00080constitutional protection for citizens. This is especially surprising
2011S01427 M00081when it is considered that it was New York's own delegation which
2011S01427 M00082prevented ratification of the original Federal Constitution until
2011S01427 M00083assurances were given that, upon ratification, work would begin on a
2011S01427 M00084Bill of Rights guaranteeing individual freedoms against government
2011S01427 M00085encroachment. It would seem a gross oversight that the very same
2011S01427 M00086protections against governmental excess which the New York delegation
2011S01427 M00087sought to prevent would nevertheless be found lacking in the New York
2011S01427 M00088State Constitution.

2011S01428 M00022A final order of protection is intended to provide protection to a
2011S01428 M00023victim or witness during the period following disposition of the
2011S01428 M00024case, when the defendant may no longer be subject to a temporary
2011S01428 M00025order of protection issued as a condition of bail or recognizance. As
2011S01428 M00026the defendant may lawfully be subject to a temporary order of
2011S01428 M00027protection right up to the date of sentencing, it serves the victim's
2011S01428 M00028best interest to have the final order begin at sentencing rather than
2011S01428 M00029conviction which may allow for an extended period in which the order
2011S01428 M00030is valid.
2011S01428 M00031Additionally this bill allows that a final order of protection may be
2011S01428 M00032issued for any crime or violation between "members of the same family
2011S01428 M00033or household" as defined in subdivision one of section 530.11 of the
2011S01428 M00034CPL. This definition includes former spouses, those who have never
2011S01428 M00035been married but have a child in common and those who have been in an
2011S01428 M00036intimate relationship.
2011S01428 M00037Expanding the definition for the purposes of a final order provides
2011S01428 M00038more victims with protection under this statute.

2011S01429 M000191,2011, requiring counties to pay the cost of treatment, maintenance

2011S01429 M00042JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01429 M00043
2011S01429 M00044Recently, the State Department of Corrections made a recommendation to
2011S01429 M00045close four state correctional facilities citing the need for
2011S01429 M00046downsizing. At the same time, a number of county correctional
2011S01429 M00047facilities across the State are experiencing overcrowding issues.
2011S01429 M00048Several counties have been issued temporary waivers from the State
2011S01429 M00049Commission on Corrections allowing them to exceed their current
2011S01429 M00050inmate bed capacity while Some county facilities have entered into
2011S01429 M00051
2011S01429 M00052agreements with other county facilities to temporarily ease
2011S01429 M00053overcrowding issues.
2011S01429 M00054
2011S01429 M00055At a time when the State is experiencing an economic downturn and
2011S01429 M00056building costs have escalated, we should be utilizing existing space
2011S01429 M00057before asking taxpayers to fund capital costs that can be avoided if
2011S01429 M00058a shared services approach is fiscally prudent. This measure requires
2011S01429 M00059the Department of Corrections to enter into an agreement with
2011S01429 M00060counties experiencing overcrowding if the State Commission on
2011S01429 M00061Corrections determines this is the best course of action to alleviate
2011S01429 M00062overcrowding.

2011S01430 M00037
2011S01430 M00038JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01430 M00039
2011S01430 M00040Many patients rely on a variety of prescription eye medications for
2011S01430 M00041the preservation of sight.
2011S01430 M00042particularly, those suffering from glaucoma and other degenerative eye
2011S01430 M00043diseases require prescription eye drops on a daily basis The
2011S01430 M00044effectiveness of prescription eye drops relies heavily upon
2011S01430 M00045continuity of treatment, specifically consistent daily usage by the
2011S01430 M00046patient.
2011S01430 M00047
2011S01430 M00048Presently, many patients run out oftheir prescription eye drops well
2011S01430 M00049before the expiration of the intended period of use denoted on the
2011S01430 M00050prescription label. This is particularly problematic for elderly
2011S01430 M00051patients with unsteady hands. However, even those using the utmost
2011S01430 M00052
2011S01430 M00053care in storing and
2011S01430 M00054using the eye drops find it nearly impossible to ration the medication
2011S01430 M00055to last the period of intended use. When a patient runs out of their
2011S01430 M00056prescription prior to the expiration of the intended period of use
2011S01430 M00057and returns to their pharmacist seeking a refill of the prescription,
2011S01430 M00058coverage is denied by the insurance company and the patient is turned
2011S01430 M00059away empty handed.
2011S01430 M00060
2011S01430 M00061Furthermore, many of these medications are not yet available in
2011S01430 M00062generic form and are very costly, thereby prohibiting patients from
2011S01430 M00063paying for the necessary prescription out of pocket which
2011S01430 M00064disproportionately burdens our elderly and infirm. Unfortunately many
2011S01430 M00065patients are unable to utilize the entirety of the medication because
2011S01430 M00066of shaky hands or a defect in the products' dispensing mechanism.
2011S01430 M00067This bill would correct the problem by allowing for authorized
2011S01430 M00068refills of the product.
2011S01430 M00069
2011S01430 M00070Failing to provide sensible refill and insurance coverage policies,
2011S01430 M00071prohibits continuity of care and puts patients at risk. Therefore, to
2011S01430 M00072ensure that patients who have prescription drug coverage continue to
2011S01430 M00073receive this important treatment it is necessary to require coverage
2011S01430 M00074for the limited refilling of prescription eye drops without regard to
2011S01430 M00075coverage restrictions for early refill of renewals. This legislation
2011S01430 M00076will provide much needed protections for those who rely on
2011S01430 M00077prescription eye drops for preservation of sight.

2011S01431 M00022This legislation provides statutory authority to the
2011S01431 M00023Adjutant General to present a burial flag to those who have honorably
2011S01431 M00024served in the New York Guard. When an individual enlists in the New
2011S01431 M00025York Guard, he or she accepts responsibility to serve the State in
2011S01431 M00026times of emergency. Additionally, if their unit is activated by the
2011S01431 M00027President they are prepared to serve their country, at home or
2011S01431 M00028abroad. Federal law furnishes flags to State Guard veterans only if
2011S01431 M00029they have been activated and called to serve abroad. If an individual
2011S01431 M00030is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country, and has
2011S01431 M00031honorably fulfilled the terms of duty, the State should honor them
2011S01431 M00032appropriately. Currently, the Military Funeral Honors Program of the
2011S01431 M00033New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs provides a flag
2011S01431 M00034upon request, but since there is no statutory authority for them to
2011S01431 M00035do so, many are unaware that a flag may be requested.

2011S01432 M00034to plan for the fiscal implications. Without adequate funding and
2011S01432 M00035time to plan for unforeseen costs, school districts have, at times,
2011S01432 M00036been forced to reduce programs, services and personnel to contend
2011S01432 M00037with new unfunded mandates imposed by the state.
2011S01432 M00038
2011S01432 M00039In December 2006, the State Education Department directed all public
2011S01432 M00040school districts to provide students taking mandated state math exams
2011S01432 M00041with graphing and/or scientific calculators to the extent that such
2011S01432 M00042calculators are a necessary part of the educational program.
2011S01432 M00043Specifically, school
2011S01432 M00044districts were informed by the State Education Department that the
2011S01432 M00045calculators must be provided to students when required in order to
2011S01432 M00046complete mandated State math and science assessments and course work.
2011S01432 M00047This particular regulation imposed a cost of roughly $100 million
2011S01432 M00048statewide. Some school districts reported spending in excess of
2011S01432 M00049$100,000 on graphing and scientific calculators to fulfill this
2011S01432 M00050unforeseen requirement.
2011S01432 M00051
2011S01432 M00052In order to ensure that school districts and taxpayers do not bave to
2011S01432 M00053contend with costly new mandates once a school budget has been
2011S01432 M00054adopted, this legislation provides schools with the time to adjust
2011S01432 M00055and plan for any new state mandates imposing a cost on a school
2011S01432 M00056district.

2011S01433 M00009murder therein

2011S01433 M00011PURPOSE:

2011S01433 M00025JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01433 M00026In 1985, the New York State Legislature approved a law allowing
2011S01433 M00027children to testify via closed circuit television in court proceedings
2011S01433 M00028involving sexual abuse. The same concern for the welfare and
2011S01433 M00029sensitivities of a child who must testify to something which is
2011S01433 M00030deeply traumatic dictates that we extend the insulation of televised
2011S01433 M00031testimony to children involved in murder and attempted murder trials
2011S01433 M00032as well.
2011S01433 M00033
2011S01433 M00034This legislation was prompted by a case in Erie County where a mother
2011S01433 M00035was accused of killing her two young daughters and attacking her son
2011S01433 M00036with a pickax. The son was required to testify against his mother
2011S01433 M00037while facing her in an open courtroom. Such testimony jeopardized the
2011S01433 M00038child's chances of emotional recovery from this traumatic occurrence.

2011S01434 M00031
2011S01434 M00032JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01434 M00033It has been reported that some insurance companies are providing
2011S01434 M00034financial incentives to doctors for switching patients' prescriptions
2011S01434 M00035to less expensive drugs. Some health plans have offered as much as
2011S01434 M00036$100 each time a physician switches a patient's prescription from a
2011S01434 M00037brand name to a generic. An upstate New York health plan began a
2011S01434 M00038pilot project with several medical groups in 2006 as part of a
2011S01434 M00039campaign to boost generic drug use. In this pilot, physicians who
2011S01434 M00040increased their ratio of generic drug prescriptions to brand-name
2011S01434 M00041drugs by five percentage points, would receive a slightly higher
2011S01434 M00042reimbursement for their patient office visits.
2011S01434 M00043
2011S01434 M00044While lowering health care costs is an essential and necessary task if
2011S01434 M00045we are to meet the goal of ensuring that every New Yorker has
2011S01434 M00046affordable quality health care, insurance companies should not offer
2011S01434 M00047incentives to influence medical decisions. Monetary rewards for
2011S01434 M00048health care providers who switch patients' prescriptions from a
2011S01434 M00049costlier drug to a less expensive one should not be an acceptable
2011S01434 M00050practice. This legislation would prevent companies in New York from
2011S01434 M00051providing "kickbacks" to participating practitioners for changing
2011S01434 M00052
2011S01434 M00053prescriptions. Although many generics work as well as their
2011S01434 M00054counterpart brand-name products, ethical medical practice requires
2011S01434 M00055that a prescribers' independent clinical judgment not be compromised.
2011S01434 M00056A patient's diagnosis, symptoms, risk of complications, medical
2011S01434 M00057profile and prior clinical history should be taken into account prior
2011S01434 M00058to changing or prescribing a prescription. The decision to prescribe
2011S01434 M00059a particular medication should be made without concern for financial
2011S01434 M00060gain.

2011S01435 M00015
2011S01435 M00016The bill adds a new section 501-e to executive law to require that the
2011S01435 M00017office of children and family services (OCFS), in collaboration with
2011S01435 M00018the office of temporary and disability assistance, report to the

2011S01435 M00022families concerning good cause for refusal to cooperate with the
2011S01435 M00023requirements of regulation 18 NYCRR 415.3(c), and any other
2011S01435 M00024regulation or directive affecting the requirement that such good
2011S01435 M00025cause be established as to why the individual is not pursuing child
2011S01435 M00026support from the non-custodial parent(s) either through the social
2011S01435 M00027services district's child support enforcement program or through
2011S01435 M00028other legal means.
2011S01435 M00029
2011S01435 M00030The report is due as soon as possible but in any case not later than
2011S01435 M00031May 29, 2009. Such report shall provide information on the following
2011S01435 M00032for the preceding calendar year, or for the nearest measurable twelve
2011S01435 M00033month period. The several items delineated for the report will
2011S01435 M00034provide a picture of the reasons why individuals are or are not
2011S01435 M00035cooperating with the directive, and whether cooperation creates
2011S01435 M00036hardship.
2011S01435 M00037
2011S01435 M00038JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01435 M00039
2011S01435 M00040There have been very serious allegations made for the past several
2011S01435 M00041years that the requirement in current State processes that low income
2011S01435 M00042custodial parents actively seek child support from non-custodial
2011S01435 M00043parents or show good cause as to why he or she cannot seek child
2011S01435 M00044support, as a condition of eligibility for a child care subsidy,
2011S01435 M00045constitutes such an extreme disincentive to many individuals in need
2011S01435 M00046of such assistance and as such fail to pursue needed assistance. The
2011S01435 M00047purpose of this bill is to obtain information as speedily as possible
2011S01435 M00048from the state agencies involved in order to take appropriate action.

2011S01436 M00013Section 1 amends §606 of the Tax Law by adding a new subsection (ss)
2011S01436 M00014to establish a tuition tax credit in the amount of 10% of the earned
2011S01436 M00015income credit a taxpayer is allowed under IRC § 32 multiplied by
2011S01436 M00016the number of dependents attending an elementary or secondary public
2011S01436 M00017or nonpublic school on a full-time basis for at least three months
2011S01436 M00018during the regular school year. This credit shall not exceed the

2011S01436 M00020exceed $500.
2011S01436 M00021
2011S01436 M00022Section 2 repeals §612 (j) of the Tax Law and adds new
2011S01436 M00023subsection j, which establishes the Tuition tax deduction. Such
2011S01436 M00024deduction shall not exceed the amount paid for each dependent in
2011S01436 M00025tuition to an elementary or secondary public or non-public school for
2011S01436 M00026the education of such dependent.
2011S01436 M00027
2011S01436 M00028JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01436 M00029In 2006, an effort to establish a tax credit to help families with
2011S01436 M00030children was established. This credit was an important step towards
2011S01436 M00031helping New York's families with child expenses, but was not linked
2011S01436 M00032specifically to educational expenses. Family expenditures for
2011S01436 M00033education can be significant and this measure aims to assist with
2011S01436 M00034these expenses.

2011S01437 M00007energy system equipment
2011S01437 M00008
2011S01437 M00009PURPOSE:
2011S01437 M00010
2011S01437 M00011This bill will extend the current tax credit provided for the purchase
2011S01437 M00012and installation of solar energy equipment to individuals who install
2011S01437 M00013and the lease solar energy equipment.
2011S01437 M00014
2011S01437 M00015SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01437 M00016
2011S01437 M00017Section 1. Paragraph 2 of subsection (g-1) of section 606 of the tax
2011S01437 M00018law is amended to add to section: (A) extending the tax credit to(ii)
2011S01437 M00019an individual who leases solar energy equipment owned and installed
2011S01437 M00020by a third party as long as the lease agreement spans at least 10
2011S01437 M00021years, resides within the State of New York, and is the principal
2011S01437 M00022residence of the tax payer. (iii) an individual who purchases the
2011S01437 M00023power under a lease agreement that spans at least 10 years where the
2011S01437 M00024power purchased is generated by solar energy equipment owned and
2011S01437 M00025installed by a third party.
2011S01437 M00026
2011S01437 M00027Section (C)-specifies the qualified expenditures covered by the
2011S01437 M00028purchase of solar energy
2011S01437 M00029
2011S01437 M00030New section-(D) expands qualified expenditures covered to include the
2011S01437 M00031amount equal to all payments to be made under a lease agreement
2011S01437 M00032including any upfront costs.
2011S01437 M00033
2011S01437 M00034JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01437 M00035
2011S01437 M00036This bill will increase and encourage the use of alternative and
2011S01437 M00037renewable energy by extending the tax credits received by the owners
2011S01437 M00038of solar energy equipment to individuals who lease such equipment.
2011S01437 M00039Purchasing, installing and maintaining this type of equipment can be
2011S01437 M00040costly and complex therefore deterring some consumers from utilizing
2011S01437 M00041this type of renewable energy.
2011S01437 M00042contracting with companies who provide these services provides an
2011S01437 M00043opportunity for a consumer to reduce their energy costs and continues
2011S01437 M00044to encourage the use of renewable energy.
2011S01437 M00045
2011S01437 M00046The impacts of climate change have made abundantly clear the need to
2011S01437 M00047reduce our carbon footprint. However, for a greater impact to occur
2011S01437 M00048it will require that everyone be involved in some way. This bill
2011S01437 M00049provides an opportunity and
2011S01437 M00050incentive for more consumers to take advantage of solar power
2011S01437 M00051generation, reduce C02 emissions and reduce their own energy costs.

2011S01438 M00004An act
2011S01438 M00005to amend the public health law and the domestic relations law, in
2011S01438 M00006relation to enacting the "bill of adoptee rights"
2011S01438 M00007
2011S01438 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S01438 M00009This bill would allow an adopted person who is at least eighteen years
2011S01438 M00010of age to request from the Department of Health a non-certified copy
2011S01438 M00011of his or her original birth certificate and/or a medical history
2011S01438 M00012form if available
2011S01438 M00013
2011S01438 M00014SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01438 M00015Section 1 of the bill amends the public health law by adding a new
2011S01438 M00016section, § 4138-e, to establish the "Bill of Adoptee Rights". An
2011S01438 M00017adoptee, who is at least 18 years old, may request and receive a
2011S01438 M00018non-certified copy of his or her original birth certificate and/or a
2011S01438 M00019medical history form, if available, upon proper identification and
2011S01438 M00020payment of a nominal fee. Where only a medical history form is
2011S01438 M00021requested, the birth certificate and contact preference form will not
2011S01438 M00022be sent, but may be requested at a later date. If a copy of the birth
2011S01438 M00023certificate cannot be provided, then the adult adoptee may secure
2011S01438 M00024from a court of competent jurisdiction or the adoption agency the
2011S01438 M00025information that would have appeared on the original birth
2011S01438 M00026certificate. A contact preference form and/or a medical history form
2011S01438 M00027may be filed by the birth parent(s) with the Department of Health at
2011S01438 M00028any time.

2011S01438 M00034
2011S01438 M00035Section 3 amends § 4138 of the public health law to provide that when
2011S01438 M00036a verified transcript or certification of birth is issued by the
2011S01438 M00037registrar, it will be required to issue the document based upon the
2011S01438 M00038original local record of birth upon a written notarized request by
2011S01438 M00039the adult adopted person once proper proof of identity is provided.
2011S01438 M00040
2011S01438 M00041Section 4 amends § 4138 of the public health law to require that when
2011S01438 M00042a commissioner makes a new birth certificate for an adult, then a
2011S01438 M00043certified copy, a certified transcript and a certification of birth
2011S01438 M00044will be forwarded to such adult.
2011S01438 M00045
2011S01438 M00046Section 5 amends § 4138 of the public health law by adding two new
2011S01438 M00047subdivisions that would allow an adult adoptee or a birth parent to
2011S01438 M00048submit to the registrar a notice of change of name and/or address and
2011S01438 M00049to be attached to the original birth certificate of the adopted
2011S01438 M00050person. If an adopted person has granted permission, then the
2011S01438 M00051
2011S01438 M00052registrar shall disclose the current name and address to the birth
2011S01438 M00053parent at the birth parent's request.
2011S01438 M00054
2011S01438 M00055Section 6 amends § 4138-d of the public health law and removes the
2011S01438 M00056provision that allows an adoption agency to restrict access to
2011S01438 M00057non-identifying information that is not in the best interest of the
2011S01438 M00058adoptee, the biological sibling or the birth parent(s).
2011S01438 M00059
2011S01438 M00060Section 7 amends § 4104 of the public health law to include additional
2011S01438 M00061provisions under vital statistics that would be applicable to the
2011S01438 M00062city of New York.
2011S01438 M00063
2011S01438 M00064Section 8 amends § 114 of the domestic relations law to require
2011S01438 M00065certain information be contained in the medical history of the child
2011S01438 M00066at the time the child is surrendered by his or her birth parent(s).
2011S01438 M00067The law guardian will have the responsibility to ensure the
2011S01438 M00068comprehensive completion and filing of the information prior to the
2011S01438 M00069acceptance of the termination of parental rights or the entry of a
2011S01438 M00070certificate of adoption. The law guardian will provide an affidavit
2011S01438 M00071to the court reporting all diligent efforts to obtain the medical
2011S01438 M00072history information and a copy of the affidavit will be appended to
2011S01438 M00073the original and amended birth certificates.
2011S01438 M00074
2011S01438 M00075Section 9 amends § 114 of the domestic relations law to allow an adult
2011S01438 M00076adoptee to request and receive a non-certified copy of his or her
2011S01438 M00077original birth certificate and/or a medical history form, if
2011S01438 M00078available, upon proper identification and payment of a nominal fee.

2011S01438 M00080Section 10 is the effective date.
2011S01438 M00081
2011S01438 M00082JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01438 M00083The "Bill of Adoptee Rights" will provide adult adoptees with access
2011S01438 M00084to information that a non-adopted person has a legal right to obtain.
2011S01438 M00085In New York, an adoptee cannot access his or her original birth
2011S01438 M00086certificate unless the adoptee goes through judicial means, and even
2011S01438 M00087then, the outcome does not guarantee that access will be granted.
2011S01438 M00088This bill will allow adult adoptees to request and receive a
2011S01438 M00089non-certified copy of an original birth certificate and/or a medical
2011S01438 M00090history form if available.
2011S01438 M00091
2011S01438 M00092Adoptees will be able to gain knowledge of their religious and ethnic
2011S01438 M00093heritage and access to medical information that may be necessary for
2011S01438 M00094preventive health care and illnesses that are linked to family
2011S01438 M00095history and genetics.
2011S01438 M00096
2011S01438 M00097A birth parent may seek to protect his or her privacy by completing a
2011S01438 M00098contact preference form that would be sent to the adult adoptee upon
2011S01438 M00099a request for a non-certified copy of an original birth certificate.

2011S01439 M00004An act
2011S01439 M00005to amend the general business law and the civil practice law and rules,
2011S01439 M00006in relation to debt collection agencies
2011S01439 M00007
2011S01439 M00008PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S01439 M00009The purpose of this bill is to protect consumers against unfair and
2011S01439 M00010deceptive debt collection practices and maintain a high level of
2011S01439 M00011integrity and professionalism in the debt collection industry, by
2011S01439 M00012requiring third party debt collectors and debt buyers to obtain a
2011S01439 M00013license from the Department of State.
2011S01439 M00014
2011S01439 M00015SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01439 M00016This bill would require third party debt collection agencies,
2011S01439 M00017including those who buy and sell consumer debt, to obtain a license
2011S01439 M00018by October 1, 2011 from the Department of State (DOS). Licenses would
2011S01439 M00019cost $500 and be valid for two years.
2011S01439 M00020
2011S01439 M00021In addition to the submission of the usual license application
2011S01439 M00022information, such as business name, address and telephone number,
2011S01439 M00023applicants would be required to submit a summary of the methods used
2011S01439 M00024to confirm the validity of the debts it seeks to collect, the
2011S01439 M00025applicant recordkeeping policy, and whether the applicant intends to
2011S01439 M00026sell debts.
2011S01439 M00027
2011S01439 M00028The Secretary of State would be authorized to refuse to issue a
2011S01439 M00029license to any applicant found to have violated New York's Fair Debt
2011S01439 M00030Collection Practices Law (Article 29-H of the General Business Law)
2011S01439 M00031or the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The Secretary
2011S01439 M00032would also be authorized to perform investigations and compel the
2011S01439 M00033attendance of witness and a licensed agencies' books and records.
2011S01439 M00034
2011S01439 M00035Debt collection agencies would be required to obtain surety bonding.
2011S01439 M00036The amount of the bond would be between $10,000 and $75,000, depending
2011S01439 M00037on the number of people employed by the agency. The bond would be
2011S01439 M00038conditioned on compliance with this article and the payment of all
2011S01439 M00039fines or investigatory costs. Agencies would also be required to
2011S01439 M00040include the license number issued by the DOS on any advertisement,
2011S01439 M00041letterhead, receipt or other printed matter produced by the agency.
2011S01439 M00042The DOS would be required to publish a registry of all licensed debt
2011S01439 M00043collection agencies on its website.
2011S01439 M00044
2011S01439 M00045The Attorney General would be authorized to enforce the provisions of
2011S01439 M00046this article by seeking an injunction against a violator. The bill
2011S01439 M00047also provides for a civil penalty of between $100 and $10,000 for each
2011S01439 M00048violation.
2011S01439 M00049
2011S01439 M00050The bill provides for a private right of action for actual damages or
2011S01439 M00051three thousand five hundred dollars, whichever is greater, or both.
2011S01439 M00052
2011S01439 M00053The court may, in its discretion, increase the award of damages to an
2011S01439 M00054amount not to exceed three times the actual damages up to ten
2011S01439 M00055thousand dollars, if the court finds the defendant willfully violated
2011S01439 M00056this article.
2011S01439 M00057
2011S01439 M00058Lastly, the bill would amend the Civil practice Law and Rules to allow
2011S01439 M00059debtors who have been sued by an unlicensed debt collection agency to
2011S01439 M00060move for dismissal of the suit based on the fact that the agency is
2011S01439 M00061not licensed pursuant to this article.
2011S01439 M00062
2011S01439 M00063JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01439 M00064Federal and state law regulate how debt collectors may communicate
2011S01439 M00065with debtors and prohibit the use of certain threatening, deceptive
2011S01439 M00066and unfair collection practices. Despite these legal protections, the
2011S01439 M00067number of consumer complaints regarding debt collection practices
2011S01439 M00068continue to rise. Consumer complaints received by the Federal Trade
2011S01439 M00069commission regarding third party debt collectors grew for the
2011S01439 M00070eleventh consecutive year in 2008, and consumers filed with the
2011S01439 M00071Commission more complaints against third party collectors than
2011S01439 M00072against any other specific industry.
2011S01439 M00073The New York city Department of Consumer Affairs recently announced
2011S01439 M00074that debt collection complaints topped the Department's annual
2011S01439 M00075complaint list for the first time in the agency's forty-year history
2011S01439 M00076in 2008.
2011S01439 M00077
2011S01439 M00078While the majority of those engaged in the business of debt collection
2011S01439 M00079are honest and ethical in their dealings, there is a minority of
2011S01439 M00080unscrupulous collection agencies in operation that practice abusive
2011S01439 M00081tactics.
2011S01439 M00082Due to the sensitive nature of the information used in the course of
2011S01439 M00083such agency's everyday business, and the vulnerable position
2011S01439 M00084consumers find themselves in when dealing with these agencies, it is
2011S01439 M00085imperative that the State protect the interests, reputations and
2011S01439 M00086fiscal well-being of its citizens against those agencies that abuse
2011S01439 M00087their privilege of operation.
2011S01439 M00088
2011S01439 M00089Third party debt collection agencies are currently required to be
2011S01439 M00090licensed in at least twenty-nine states, as well as, the cities of

2011S01440 M00003TITLE OF BILL:
2011S01440 M00004An act
2011S01440 M00005to amend the penal law and the general business law, in relation to
2011S01440 M00006banning the possession, sale or manufacture of assault weapons;
2011S01440 M00007and to
2011S01440 M00008repeal subdivision 22 of section 265.00 of the penal law relating
2011S01440 M00009thereto
2011S01440 M00010
2011S01440 M00011PURPOSE:
2011S01440 M00012To expand and improve New York State's ban on military-style assault
2011S01440 M00013weapons.
2011S01440 M00014
2011S01440 M00015SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01440 M00016Section 1 amends Penal Law § 265.00(22) to expand and clarify the
2011S01440 M00017characteristics of what constitutes an "assault weapon" to include
2011S01440 M00018semiautomatic rifles with a "forward grip" or a "barrel shroud" and
2011S01440 M00019semiautomatic shotguns with a second pistol grip.
2011S01440 M00020
2011S01440 M00021It would also add 51 new assault weapons to the existing list of
2011S01440 M00022banned guns. Among the new assault weapons proposed for inclusion in
2011S01440 M00023the list are the Galil Sniper Rifle, the Bushmaster XM15, and the SKS.
2011S01440 M00024
2011S01440 M00025It also adds conversion kits, for converting a firearm into an assault
2011S01440 M00026weapon, to the list of banned items. § 2 defines the terms "barrel
2011S01440 M00027shroud," "conversion kit," "detachable magazine," "fixed magazine,"
2011S01440 M00028"folding or telescoping stock," "forward grip," "pistol grip" and
2011S01440 M00029"threaded barrel".
2011S01440 M00030
2011S01440 M00031EXISTING LAW:
2011S01440 M00032Current law bans a number of specific weapons and their copies and
2011S01440 M00033semiautomatic pistols and rifles with a detachable ammunition
2011S01440 M00034magazine and two or more military style features. Specific banned
2011S01440 M00035weapons include AK-47s, Uzis, Tec-9s, and Street Sweepers.
2011S01440 M00036
2011S01440 M00037JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01440 M00038This proposal will significantly strengthen New York State's current
2011S01440 M00039law prohibiting the sale, possession and use of military-style
2011S01440 M00040assault weapons, particularly in light of the expiration of the 1994
2011S01440 M00041federal law banning such weapons.
2011S01440 M00042
2011S01440 M00043The gun industry has worked to evade the recently expired federal
2011S01440 M00044assault weapon ban by making insignificant, mostly cosmetic, changes
2011S01440 M00045in the design of banned assault weapons and then marketing them as
2011S01440 M00046"post-ban"
2011S01440 M00047guns. In 2002, the Washington, DC-area snipers used a Bushmaster
2011S01440 M00048"post-ban" AR-15-style assault rifle in a killing spree that left 10
2011S01440 M00049dead and three wounded. At the same time, new assault weapons have
2011S01440 M00050come onto the marketplace, such as the Hi-Point Carbine used in the
2011S01440 M000511999 Columbine massacre.
2011S01440 M00052
2011S01440 M00053Assault weapons, both pre- and post-ban guns, continue to pose a
2011S01440 M00054serious threat to the police and public throughout the United States.
2011S01440 M00055According to FBI data, assault weapons were used to kill one out of
2011S01440 M00056five law enforcement officers slain in the line of duty from 1998
2011S01440 M00057through 2001.
2011S01440 M00058Assault weapons have been used in some of the most notorious mass
2011S01440 M00059shootings since the federal ban was enacted in 1994, including the
2011S01440 M000601997 shooting at the Caltrans Maintenance Yard in Orange, California,
2011S01440 M00061where four were killed and two were wounded (AK-47 assault rifle),
2011S01440 M00062the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 that left 13 dead and 23
2011S01440 M00063wounded (TEC-DC9 assault pistol and Hi-Point Carbine), the 2000
2011S01440 M00064shooting at the Edgewater Technology office in Wakefield,
2011S01440 M00065Massachusetts, that left seven dead (AK-47 assault rifle) and, the
2011S01440 M000662001 shooting at Navistar International Corporation in which four
2011S01440 M00067were killed and four wounded (SKS assault rifle).
2011S01440 M00068
2011S01440 M00069New York State's assault weapon ban law works. It has made the streets
2011S01440 M00070of New York State safer. An improved assault weapon ban will provide
2011S01440 M00071even more protection for New Yorkers, especially the men and women of
2011S01440 M00072the law enforcement community.

2011S01441 M00004An act
2011S01441 M00005to amend the penal law, in relation to unlawful possession of a knife
2011S01441 M00006upon school grounds
2011S01441 M00007
2011S01441 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S01441 M00009This act would make it unlawful for any person age sixteen or older to
2011S01441 M00010knowingly possess a knife in an educational institution.
2011S01441 M00011
2011S01441 M00012SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01441 M00013Section one amends Section 265.06 of the Penal law by adding knives
2011S01441 M00014among dangerous weapons prohibited in or on the grounds of any
2011S01441 M00015school, college or university, without written authorization of such
2011S01441 M00016educational institutions, by those persons over the age of sixteen.
2011S01441 M00017
2011S01441 M00018JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01441 M00019Creating and maintaining a safe learning environment is essential.
2011S01441 M00020While educational institutions remain among the safest places for
2011S01441 M00021young people, instances of violence among high school students have
2011S01441 M00022been on the rise. Current law makes it unlawful for any person age
2011S01441 M00023sixteen or younger to possess any type of air gun or dangerous knife
2011S01441 M00024in or upon a building or grounds used for educational purposes, of
2011S01441 M00025any school, college or university, without the written authorization
2011S01441 M00026of such educational institution. with regard to those persons age
2011S01441 M00027sixteen or older, the law disallows only air guns on school grounds.
2011S01441 M00028This legislation simply adds knives to the list of weapons already
2011S01441 M00029prohibited on school grounds by those sixteen years of age or older.
2011S01441 M00030Knives are among one of the most devastating and easily concealed
2011S01441 M00031weapons available. Preventing school violence is necessary in
2011S01441 M00032promoting a healthy learning environment. This provision will help
2011S01441 M00033school officials and police officers to more effectively address
2011S01441 M00034incidents involving weapons on the grounds of and within educational
2011S01441 M00035institutions.

2011S01442 M00006court,

2011S01442 M00009such law relating thereto
2011S01442 M00010
2011S01442 M00011PURPOSE:
2011S01442 M00012This bill would eliminate the various pay scales and provide that all
2011S01442 M00013trial judges, at the county and supreme court level, receive the same
2011S01442 M00014salary.
2011S01442 M00015
2011S01442 M00016SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01442 M00017Section 221-b states that the salary of justices of the supreme court
2011S01442 M00018and judges of the county, family, and surrogate courts shall be the
2011S01442 M00019same.
2011S01442 M00020
2011S01442 M00021JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01442 M00022This legislation would eliminate the judicial pay disparities that
2011S01442 M00023exist in New York State. There is no other state that has such a
2011S01442 M00024fractured and irrational compensation plan. For example, New York is
2011S01442 M00025the only state that pays its felony trial judges less than its civil
2011S01442 M00026court judges and New York is one of only a few states that pays its
2011S01442 M00027family court judges less then its civil court judges. Currently,
2011S01442 M00028supreme court judges are paid the same in New York regardless of
2011S01442 M00029their location; yet this is not true for family, county and surrogate
2011S01442 M00030court judges. One argument often made against pay equity for judges
2011S01442 M00031is the cost of living differences between jurisdictions. However, all
2011S01442 M00032Senators and Assembly members are paid the same regardless of their
2011S01442 M00033district location. It is the intent of this bill to bring to light
2011S01442 M00034judicial any disparities and provide a meaningful solution.

2011S01443 M00019inconsiderate, and unnecessary. Before receiving a driver's license,
2011S01443 M00020New Yorkers should be taught the laws pertaining to handicapped
2011S01443 M00021parking. Making more New Yorkers aware of these laws should reduce
2011S01443 M00022the number of illegal parking violations, and improve awareness and

2011S01444 M00024of public assistance so long as the funds are used for the intended

2011S01444 M00036JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01444 M00037with more individuals moving from welfare to work, it is necessary to
2011S01444 M00038create stable, decent-paying jobs that will allow individuals to
2011S01444 M00039remain off public assistance. One way to address this problem is by
2011S01444 M00040encouraging self-employment for those who have the capability.
2011S01444 M00041Several agencies in Albany County have indicated that they would like
2011S01444 M00042to provide loans to welfare recipients for the purpose of becoming
2011S01444 M00043self-employed. Further, as large corporations downsize, small
2011S01444 M00044business is one of the fastest growing employment sectors in our
2011S01444 M00045economy. Facilitating self-employment for both welfare recipients and
2011S01444 M00046the working poor will allow them to enter this growing field.
2011S01444 M00047Creating a "community capital loan program" would benefit welfare
2011S01444 M00048recipients across the state. It may also prevent certain low-income
2011S01444 M00049individuals from ever becoming dependent on public assistance.

2011S01445 M00005to amend the education law, in relation to local approval of charter
2011S01445 M00006schools in certain districts
2011S01445 M00007
2011S01445 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S01445 M00009To ensure some local oversight over charter schools outside of New
2011S01445 M00010York city.
2011S01445 M00011
2011S01445 M00012SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01445 M00013Amends section 2851-a of the education law to require a charter school
2011S01445 M00014to submit an application to the local school board for approval
2011S01445 M00015before an application can be submitted to a chartering entity. This
2011S01445 M00016application must include an economic and financial impact statement
2011S01445 M00017in addition to other information relevant to the application. If the
2011S01445 M00018local school board does not approve the charter school application,
2011S01445 M00019the applicant cannot apply to a chartering entity.
2011S01445 M00020
2011S01445 M00021JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01445 M00022Currently, there have been twelve charter schools approved for the
2011S01445 M00023Albany city school District. Under current law, the school district
2011S01445 M00024has no input into the approval process of charter applications and
2011S01445 M00025that has resulted in the district's saturation. The goal of this
2011S01445 M00026legislation is to provide school districts with input into a process
2011S01445 M00027where the outcomes affects them greatly. While the charter schools
2011S01445 M00028deserve adequate funding, the formula on how they receive this
2011S01445 M00029funding is flawed. The Albany city School District has to take on the
2011S01445 M00030burden of eliminating their programs, resources, as well as faculty
2011S01445 M00031in order to fund these charter schools.

2011S01446 M00005proposing an amendment
2011S01446 M00006to section 7 of article 4 of the constitution, in relation to
2011S01446 M00007legislative bills
2011S01446 M00008
2011S01446 M00009PURPOSE:
2011S01446 M00010This bill would amend the Constitution by requiring that legislation
2011S01446 M00011passed by the senate and Assembly must be presented to the Governor
2011S01446 M00012within a definitive time frame.
2011S01446 M00013
2011S01446 M00014SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01446 M00015Section 1 - requires that every bill that has passed the Senate and
2011S01446 M00016Assembly shall be presented to the Governor within thirty days of
2011S01446 M00017receipt by the house of origin, provided, however if the bill is
2011S01446 M00018returned to the house of origin after May 1st, then it must be
2011S01446 M00019presented to the Governor within forty-five days.
2011S01446 M00020
2011S01446 M00021Section 2 - states that the foregoing be referred to the first regular
2011S01446 M00022legislative session convening after the next succeeding general
2011S01446 M00023election of members of the assembly, and, in conformity with section
2011S01446 M000241 of article 19 of the constitution, be published for 3 months
2011S01446 M00025previous to the time of such election.
2011S01446 M00026
2011S01446 M00027JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01446 M00028In the 1994 lawsuit titled CAMPAIGN FOR FISCAL EQUITY, INC. V.
2011S01446 M00029MARINO, the petitioners claimed that after the "Maintenance of Effort"
2011S01446 M00030bill passed both the Assembly and the Senate, the Legislature had
2011S01446 M00031intentionally refused to present this bill to the Governor regardless
2011S01446 M00032of the constitutional requirement to do so. After a lengthy court
2011S01446 M00033battle, the Court of Appeals held that it was unconstitutional to
2011S01446 M00034withhold bills from the Governor that had been acted on by both
2011S01446 M00035houses. The intent of this bill is to further clarify the
2011S01446 M00036constitutional requirement set forth in Article 4, Section 7. It is
2011S01446 M00037not uncommon for the presentment of a bill to be delayed. In the
2011S01446 M00038past, bills have been detained for various political and legislative
2011S01446 M00039reasons. These delays further frustrate the open and orderly process
2011S01446 M00040of government. This measure would help to ensure that bills are
2011S01446 M00041presented in a timely fashion.

2011S01447 M00003TITLE OF BILL:
2011S01447 M00004An act
2011S01447 M00005to amend the environmental conservation law, the
2011S01447 M00006general municipal law and the tax law, in relation to
2011S01447 M00007authorizing cities and towns to impose a tax on real estate
2011S01447 M00008transfers, and authorizing municipalities to create community
2011S01447 M00009preservation funds
2011S01447 M00010
2011S01447 M00011PURPOSE:
2011S01447 M00012To authorize towns and cities in New York State to adopt, upon
2011S01447 M00013approval by a voter referendum, a transfer tax on real property
2011S01447 M00014transactions of up to 2% for the purpose of establishing a community
2011S01447 M00015preservation fund to be used to preserve community character through
2011S01447 M00016conservation of land or preservation of historic places or buildings.
2011S01447 M00017This measure would authorize towns and cities across the State to
2011S01447 M00018establish a local source of funds modeled on the successful program
2011S01447 M00019that has been established by the five towns at the east end of Long
2011S01447 M00020Island.
2011S01447 M00021
2011S01447 M00022SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01447 M00023Sections one and two of the bill provide for review of community
2011S01447 M00024preservation project plans by the regional advisory councils
2011S01447 M00025established pursuant to the New York State Open Space Plan process
2011S01447 M00026and by the State Land Acquisition council comprised of governmental
2011S01447 M00027leaders pursuant to existing statute.
2011S01447 M00028
2011S01447 M00029Section three of the bill adds a new section 248 to the General
2011S01447 M00030Municipal Law that authorizes towns and cities to establish, upon
2011S01447 M00031approval by a voter referendum in the local jurisdiction, a community
2011S01447 M00032preservation fund for the purposes of conserving land and historic
2011S01447 M00033preservation in that city or town.
2011S01447 M00034
2011S01447 M00035Section four of the bill adds a new article 31-F of the tax law that
2011S01447 M00036provides for a real estate transfer tax of up to 2% in towns and
2011S01447 M00037cities for providing monies for their community Preservation Funds.
2011S01447 M00038
2011S01447 M00039Section five of the bill provides for severability, and section six of
2011S01447 M00040the bill is the effective date.
2011S01447 M00041
2011S01447 M00042JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01447 M00043Undeveloped and agricultural lands in New York State are disappearing
2011S01447 M00044at a rapid rate. In the effort to conserve land, communities across
2011S01447 M00045New York State are exploring a range of options from land use
2011S01447 M00046planning activities to outright purchase of property. In conserving
2011S01447 M00047land, communities are pursuing different objectives such as providing
2011S01447 M00048parkland, safeguarding drinking water, conserving farmland,
2011S01447 M00049protecting habitat, preserving spectacular scenic views and
2011S01447 M00050preserving properties of historical significance. To achieve these
2011S01447 M00051
2011S01447 M00052ends, localities may need new sources of financial resources. This
2011S01447 M00053legislation provides communities with an option.
2011S01447 M00054
2011S01447 M00055Without this bill, each separate town or city that wants to establish
2011S01447 M00056a community preservation fund with monies garnered from the real
2011S01447 M00057estate transfer tax transactions will have to seek State enabling
2011S01447 M00058legislation.
2011S01447 M00059This can be a difficult and time-consuming process, and in the recent
2011S01447 M00060past, several localities have not been able to secure State
2011S01447 M00061legislative approval despite local public support for the initiative.
2011S01447 M00062
2011S01447 M00063Five towns on the east end of Long Island have set a precedent that
2011S01447 M00064this approach can be highly effective in getting financial resources
2011S01447 M00065to those towns that are actively involved in land conservation and
2011S01447 M00066preservation of community character. This bill would empower
2011S01447 M00067communities across New York State by allowing them the same
2011S01447 M00068opportunity to establish a community preservation fund. Empowering
2011S01447 M00069local governments through this enabling legislation is consistent
2011S01447 M00070with New York State's long held tradition of respecting local home
2011S01447 M00071rules.

2011S01449 M00012PURPOSE:
2011S01449 M00013
2011S01449 M00014This bill would require that school districts shall distribute

2011S01449 M00019
2011S01449 M00020Paragraphs (b) and (c) of subdivision 6 of section 168-1 of the
2011S01449 M00021correction law, paragraph (b) as amended by chapter 106 of the laws
2011S01449 M00022of 2006 and paragraph (c) as separately amended by chapters 318 and
2011S01449 M00023680 of the laws of 2005, are amended.
2011S01449 M00024
2011S01449 M00025JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01449 M00026
2011S01449 M00027Megan's Law requires level two and level three sex offenders resister
2011S01449 M00028with local law enforcement agencies, who may distribute information
2011S01449 M00029including the offenders name, picture, address, location of
2011S01449 M00030employment and background information.
2011S01449 M00031
2011S01449 M00032This legislation would require school districts, upon receiving this
2011S01449 M00033information from law enforcement officials, to distribute the
2011S01449 M00034information to the residents of their school district.
2011S01449 M00035
2011S01449 M00036The rate of recidivism among sex offenders is very high, as such, it
2011S01449 M00037is important that the public is aware of any dangerous offenders who
2011S01449 M00038may be living in their neighborhood. The information is currently
2011S01449 M00039available to the public, but many parents are not aware of this, or
2011S01449 M00040do not know where to look to find the information. Sending the
2011S01449 M00041offenders' profiles to each residence in the school
2011S01449 M00042district provides an extra assurance that each household has the
2011S01449 M00043invaluable information that could protect children from dangerous
2011S01449 M00044predators.
2011S01449 M00045
2011S01449 M00046This legislation provides funding to reimburse the school districts
2011S01449 M00047for their costs related to complying with this requirement.

2011S01450 M00016JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01450 M00017The East End of Long Island possesses a unique infrastructure and
2011S01450 M00018population. Local towns and residents have had a longstanding
2011S01450 M00019disappointment with the Long Island Rail Road and its inaction and
2011S01450 M00020inattentiveness to problems on the East End. It is the goal of this
2011S01450 M00021legislation to create a regional transportation authority that is
2011S01450 M00022familiar with and can concentrate on local, regional transportation
2011S01450 M00023matters. Its purpose will be the continuance, further development and
2011S01450 M00024improvement of transportation and other related services.
2011S01450 M00025
2011S01450 M00026The Peconic Bay regional transportation district shall be comprised of
2011S01450 M00027the Towns of Brookhaven, East Hampton, Riverhead, Southampton,
2011S01450 M00028Shelter Island, Southampton and Southold. The six members of the
2011S01450 M00029Authority would be the town supervisors (or their appointed designee)
2011S01450 M00030of each of these towns - one of which would be elected chairperson by
2011S01450 M00031the members.
2011S01450 M00032
2011S01450 M00033The Authority will be responsible for the preparation of a plan
2011S01450 M00034relating to the continuance, further development and improvement of
2011S01450 M00035transportation and other related services of the District.
2011S01450 M00036The plan would discuss transportation alternatives including, but not
2011S01450 M00037limited to, creation of park and rail facilities, establishment of
2011S01450 M00038shuttle trains, addition of more nonstop trains from New York City to

2011S01451 M00026Section 5 Effective date.
2011S01451 M00027
2011S01451 M00028JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01451 M00029Currently, the MTA is exempt from the authority of
2011S01451 M00030local government, local laws, ordinances, resolutions, and rules and
2011S01451 M00031regulations, including zoning and land use laws. This means that the
2011S01451 M00032MTA, which has proven itself to be unaccountable to the public and
2011S01451 M00033local government, can construct or change local railroad stations
2011S01451 M00034without regard to community character, historic preservation, or
2011S01451 M00035other quality of life concerns.
2011S01451 M00036
2011S01451 M00037Specifically, with regard to the Long Island Railroad, the MTA
2011S01451 M00038recently released a plan to modify stations in its diesel territory
2011S01451 M00039which could adversely alter these stations and the communities in
2011S01451 M00040which they are located.
2011S01451 M00041
2011S01451 M00042Of particular importance is the face that such railroad facilities are
2011S01451 M00043frequently centrally located in communities and are a hub where many
2011S01451 M00044people often congregate.
2011S01451 M00045In short, railroad facilities are an important element in the
2011S01451 M00046character of a community.
2011S01451 M00047
2011S01451 M00048Therefore, it is imperative that local government have a say in how a
2011S01451 M00049community resource, such as a railroad station is constructed or
2011S01451 M00050modified.
2011S01451 M00051
2011S01451 M00052The granting of site plan review over MTA rail facilities is the best
2011S01451 M00053way of insuring that community character is maintained without
2011S01451 M00054placing an undue burden on the MTA to perform its responsibilities or
2011S01451 M00055providing mass transit services.

2011S01452 M00018
2011S01452 M00019JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01452 M00020For the increased protection and improved safety of commuters and
2011S01452 M00021employees, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) currently
2011S01452 M00022administers a program that provides free transportation on the Long
2011S01452 M00023Island Rail Road (LIRR) for certain police officers. Police officers
2011S01452 M00024employed the City of New York, the County of Nassau, Nassau County
2011S01452 M00025villages and cities, County of Suffolk, Suffolk County towns and
2011S01452 M00026villages, the Division of State Police, the Port Authority of New
2011S01452 M00027York and New Jersey, the Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company, the
2011S01452 M00028New York City Housing Authority and the New York City Transit
2011S01452 M00029Authority have been actively participating in this no fare program
2011S01452 M00030over the past several years.
2011S01452 M00031
2011S01452 M00032A recent audit conducted by the MTA, however, revealed an apparent
2011S01452 M00033oversight in the provisions of law governing the LIRR's Free Police
2011S01452 M00034Program, § 1266 (14) of the Public Authorities Law.
2011S01452 M00035Those police officers employed by the towns within Suffolk County are
2011S01452 M00036not included in statute.
2011S01452 M00037As a result, the MTA can no longer allow these police officers to
2011S01452 M00038participate in the LIRR Free Police Ride Program as of January 1, 2011.
2011S01452 M00039
2011S01452 M00040While the reason for this omission is unclear, the LIRR has indicated
2011S01452 M00041its support for amending the statute to add police officers employed
2011S01452 M00042by the towns in Suffolk County. This legislation merely corrects this
2011S01452 M00043oversight to grant the MTA the legal authority to extend this
2011S01452 M00044program to these officers.

2011S01453 M00027The issue of creating the State of Long Island in Nassau and Suffolk
2011S01453 M00028counties has long been a topic of debate. This bill would create a

2011S01453 M00030participate in a non binding referendum.
2011S01453 M00031
2011S01453 M00032This issue requires full participation of the citizens for Nassau and
2011S01453 M00033Suffolk on whether any process for statehood should be initiated.
2011S01453 M00034This bill will allow for a full discussion of the myriad of issues
2011S01453 M00035involved in such endeavor and allow the citizens of the two counties

2011S01454 M00008
2011S01454 M00009PURPOSE:
2011S01454 M00010
2011S01454 M00011This bill exempts municipalities from the responsibility for hazardous
2011S01454 M00012waste remedial programs for properties which they acquired through
2011S01454 M00013escheat, involuntary transfer, condemnation, or eminent domain, if
2011S01454 M00014the municipality did not contribute to the wastes found on the site.
2011S01454 M00015
2011S01454 M00016SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01454 M00017
2011S01454 M00018This bill amends the state Superfund Program, Section 27-1313 of the
2011S01454 M00019Environmental Conservation Law. This bill would exempt municipalities
2011S01454 M00020from financial responsibility for remedial action on property which
2011S01454 M00021they received title through escheat, involuntary transfer or
2011S01454 M00022acquisition, eminent domain purchase or condemnation, unless the
2011S01454 M00023municipality participated in the generation, transportation, or
2011S01454 M00024disposal of the hazardous wastes or substances located on the property.
2011S01454 M00025
2011S01454 M00026EXISTING LAW:
2011S01454 M00027
2011S01454 M00028This bill would codify in New York State Law the exemption offered to
2011S01454 M00029municipalities in the Federal Superfund Law (CERC-LA, Comprehensive
2011S01454 M00030Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act) for fiscal
2011S01454 M00031responsibility for contaminated property remediation.
2011S01454 M00032
2011S01454 M00033JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01454 M00034
2011S01454 M00035As properties contaminated with hazardous wastes and substances lose
2011S01454 M00036their resale value many land owners allow the contaminated property
2011S01454 M00037to be claimed by municipalities to payoff their tax liability and to
2011S01454 M00038dispose of the property. This leaves many municipalities throughout
2011S01454 M00039the state
2011S01454 M00040owning and being responsible for numerous contaminated properties. The
2011S01454 M00041current State Superfund program requires responsible parties to
2011S01454 M00042remediate the hazardous wastes found on the site. The law defines
2011S01454 M00043responsible parties as any entity that generated, transported or
2011S01454 M00044disposed of the wastes at the site and the current land owner. If a
2011S01454 M00045municipality was not involved with the generation, transportation, or
2011S01454 M00046disposal of the waste on the site, it should not be held responsible
2011S01454 M00047for the clean-up of lands they received through the default of taxes.
2011S01454 M00048The original owners of the land and generators of the wastes should
2011S01454 M00049be responsible for the remediation of the site, not the taxpayers of
2011S01454 M00050a community that did not contribute to the contamination.

2011S01455 M00010
2011S01455 M00011Provides for local tidal wetlands protection.
2011S01455 M00012
2011S01455 M00013SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01455 M00014
2011S01455 M00015This bill adds a new Title 5 to Article 25 of the Environmental
2011S01455 M00016Conservation Law to allow each local government, after September 1,
2011S01455 M000172011, to adopt, amend, and, upon the filing of the appropriate tidal
2011S01455 M00018wetlands map, implement a tidal wetland protection law or ordinance
2011S01455 M00019to be applicable to all tidal wetlands wholly or partially within its
2011S01455 M00020jurisdiction. No local tidal wetlands protection law or ordinance
2011S01455 M00021shall be less protective of tidal wetlands than the regulations in
2011S01455 M00022effect pursuant to the provisions of the Environmental Conservation
2011S01455 M00023Law ("ECL"), and no local tidal wetlands law or ordinance may affect
2011S01455 M00024the activities currently exempted from permit by Section 25-0401 of
2011S01455 M00025the ECL, such as commercial or recreational fishing or activities of
2011S01455 M00026the Department of Health or of local government with respect to
2011S01455 M00027matters of public health.
2011S01455 M00028
2011S01455 M00029If a city, town or village fails to adopt and implement a tidal
2011S01455 M00030wetlands protection law or ordinance by the date the applicable tidal
2011S01455 M00031wetlands map is filed by the DEC, it shall be deemed to have
2011S01455 M00032transferred the function to the county. If the county fails, within
2011S01455 M00033ninety days after the date of filing of the tidal wetlands map, or by
2011S01455 M00034September 1, 2011, whichever is later, to adopt and implement a tidal
2011S01455 M00035wetlands protection law or ordinance, it shall be deemed to have
2011S01455 M00036transferred the function to the DEC.
2011S01455 M00037
2011S01455 M00038JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01455 M00039
2011S01455 M00040Under current law, local governments can administer a similar program
2011S01455 M00041for freshwater wetlands. As such, this bill would make the law
2011S01455 M00042consistent among both the tidal and freshwater wetlands programs. In
2011S01455 M00043addition, costs to New York State to administer the program could be
2011S01455 M00044reduced if localities decide they want to participate. Since it will
2011S01455 M00045be up to the local government to make the decision to voluntarily
2011S01455 M00046implement a tidal wetlands program, it is not a mandate.

2011S01456 M00004An act
2011S01456 M00005to amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to authorizing
2011S01456 M00006the catching and possession of five times the daily limit for any
2011S01456 M00007species of fish during any seven consecutive day period and authorizing
2011S01456 M00008the catching and possession on a single vessel of the daily limits of
2011S01456 M00009any species of fish for which a person aboard such vessel holds a
2011S01456 M00010license for the taking thereof; and providing for the repeal of such
2011S01456 M00011provisions upon the expiration thereof
2011S01456 M00012
2011S01456 M00013PURPOSE:
2011S01456 M00014Authorizes the catching and possession of up to 5 times the
2011S01456 M00015daily limit of fish during any seven day period of time.
2011S01456 M00016
2011S01456 M00017SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01456 M00018The Environmental Conservation law is amended
2011S01456 M00019by adding a new section 13-0373 relating to the aggregation of daily
2011S01456 M00020and trip catch and possession limits.
2011S01456 M00021
2011S01456 M00022JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01456 M00023This bill is intended to help commercial fishermen
2011S01456 M00024conserve fuel by allowing them to fish for five times the daily catch
2011S01456 M00025limit allowable under their fishing license in the aggregate over a
2011S01456 M00026period of seven days.
2011S01456 M00027Therefore, a fisherman could, for example, catch three times the daily
2011S01456 M00028catch limit on Monday and two times the limit on Wednesday and then
2011S01456 M00029stay off the water until the following Monday when a consecutive
2011S01456 M00030period of seven days is over. The bill also would allow individuals
2011S01456 M00031with different fishing licenses to go out and catch each of their
2011S01456 M00032daily limits from the same boat (this is currently prohibited).
2011S01456 M00033
2011S01456 M00034The reason for this legislation is that the current price of fuel for
2011S01456 M00035running a fishing boat is extremely expensive and cost prohibitive.
2011S01456 M00036It significantly cuts into the already slim profits of fishermen who
2011S01456 M00037are trying to make a living. This bill would allow fishermen to
2011S01456 M00038conserve fuel by keeping their boats off the water more often since
2011S01456 M00039they would be allowed to aggregate their daily catch limits over a
2011S01456 M00040seven day period. The fact that they can only catch five times the
2011S01456 M00041amount of fish in the aggregate over a seven day period creates a
2011S01456 M00042fair balance for the convenience and cost-savings they would enjoy.
2011S01456 M00043This bill would sunset on January 1, 2013 at which time the success of
2011S01456 M00044this approach could be fully evaluated and the necessity of an
2011S01456 M00045extension determined.

2011S01457 M00017persons in danger of drowning.
2011S01457 M00018
2011S01457 M00019JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01457 M00020This legislation is being introduced at the request of the Hampton
2011S01457 M00021Lifeguard Association (HLA).
2011S01457 M00022One of the many programs the HLA has been sponsoring for over eight
2011S01457 M00023years is the Volunteer Ocean Rescue Squad. This team consists of over
2011S01457 M0002440 ocean-certified members who respond and make ocean rescues at any
2011S01457 M00025unprotected beach, day or night, all year long. Their goal is to have
2011S01457 M00026at least five rescue swimmers at the rescue site with the necessary
2011S01457 M00027safety equipment in less than five minutes.
2011S01457 M00028
2011S01457 M00029Section 1341 of the Public Health Law relates to safety requirements
2011S01457 M00030for bathing establishments along the seashore of the State of New
2011S01457 M00031York..It requires persons maintaining an y such bathing establishment
2011S01457 M00032to keep and provide a surf boat measuring at least sixteen feet long
2011S01457 M00033for the facilitation of the rescue of persons in danger of drowning.
2011S01457 M00034In an effort to enhance response time and rescue operations, this
2011S01457 M00035measure makes these provisions for personal watercrafts as well.

2011S01458 M00026social services departments to enter into an agreement with the State
2011S01458 M00027Department of Health granting access to the official list of death
2011S01458 M00028certificates on file with the Department.
2011S01458 M00029
2011S01458 M00030Death certificates are not public records and acquiring them can be an
2011S01458 M00031onerous task for social service agencies. In some cases, quicker
2011S01458 M00032access to these vital records could assist in the prevention of
2011S01458 M00033public assistance abuse. The State Department of Health maintains the
2011S01458 M00034official list of all death certificates filed in New York. This
2011S01458 M00035measure would provide social service agencies with a more streamlined
2011S01458 M00036and timely procedure to obtain information on reported deaths by
2011S01458 M00037submitting a list of clients names and other identifying information
2011S01458 M00038and cross-checking it against the Department's official list.

2011S01459 M00040Expanding traffic congestion in the Peconic Bay region
2011S01459 M00041has resulted in deteriorating traffic safety, declining air quality,
2011S01459 M00042parking problems, and adverse impacts to the historical and rural
2011S01459 M00043resources of the area, and has impeded further growth and development
2011S01459 M00044in the region. In order to preserve the tourism industry, and provide
2011S01459 M00045comfort for the permanent residents of the region, the issue of
2011S01459 M00046traffic congestion must be addressed.
2011S01459 M00047
2011S01459 M00048As the unique geography of the region does not permit highway
2011S01459 M00049expansion, the solution lies with the expansion of the public transit
2011S01459 M00050system in the region.
2011S01459 M00051
2011S01459 M00052This legislation would create an entity to coordinate the local
2011S01459 M00053governments, state government and federal government and other
2011S01459 M00054interested parties to create and establish a successful public
2011S01459 M00055transit initiative for the Peconic Bay region. Bringing the
2011S01459 M00056stakeholders and community members together in the development of the
2011S01459 M00057plan will ensure an open and comprehensive decision making process.

2011S01460 M00014Amends §3445 of the Insurance Law to clarify that catastrophic
2011S01460 M00015windstorm damage deductibles shall only be applicable to hurricanes
2011S01460 M00016with windspeeds of 125 miles per hour or greater and limits the

2011S01460 M00019JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01460 M00020The residents of the coastal areas of the state have been for the past
2011S01460 M00021few years, subject to a homeowner's insurance market that has
2011S01460 M00022vacillated and fluctuated. Without real damage experience in these
2011S01460 M00023areas, insurance companies have instituted policies of huge
2011S01460 M00024deductibles predicated on hurricanes with minimum windspeeds. This
2011S01460 M00025bill will provide those residents with a stable market with
2011S01460 M00026reasonable coverage.

2011S01461 M00015as amended by Section 6 of part GG of Chapter 56 of the Laws of 2009,
2011S01461 M00016is amended to include cooperative library systems in the definition

2011S01461 M00019
2011S01461 M00020JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01461 M00021The Local Government Efficiency Grant Program was established in New
2011S01461 M00022York State to help promote and fund service sharing and
2011S01461 M00023consolidations to ultimately save taxpayer dollars.
2011S01461 M00024Funding from this program is currently available to counties, cities,
2011S01461 M00025town, villages, special improvement districts, fire districts, school
2011S01461 M00026districts, BOCES, water and sewer authorities, and regional planning
2011S01461 M00027and developments boards. Public library systems are also eligible
2011S01461 M00028under this program; however, cooperative library systems are not.
2011S01461 M00029Cooperative library systems' sole mission is to support public
2011S01461 M00030library projects that consolidate services, eliminate waste, make
2011S01461 M00031operations more efficient and most importantly save taxpayers money.
2011S01461 M00032This legislation is necessary to include the eligibility of
2011S01461 M00033cooperative library systems in this program thereby allowing this
2011S01461 M00034agency to enhance their efforts on behalf of hard pressed taxpayers.

2011S01462 M00029and(c) proper documentation required. Further provides that "ordinary
2011S01462 M00030maintenance and repairs" do not qualify for this exemption.
2011S01462 M00031
2011S01462 M00032Section 4 provides for the commencement of the exemption upon the
2011S01462 M00033approval of the assessor. The exemption will be effective after the
2011S01462 M00034taxable status date.

2011S01462 M00038reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting energy efficiency in
2011S01462 M00039homes and businesses throughout the state. significant measures have
2011S01462 M00040been enacted in an effort to accomplish this goal. This legislation
2011S01462 M00041would allow municipal corporations to adopt local laws granting a
2011S01462 M00042real property tax exemption for property improvements meeting LEED
2011S01462 M00043certification standards for energy efficient buildings. This
2011S01462 M00044incentive would further build upon New York's efforts by encouraging
2011S01462 M00045more homeowners and businesses to go "green".

2011S01463 M00013SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01463 M00014Subdivisions 3, 9, and 10 of Section

2011S01463 M00016registered nurses.
2011S01463 M00017
2011S01463 M00018JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01463 M00019To provide quality health care for New Yorkers, it is
2011S01463 M00020essential to have a constant supply of registered nurses, yet health
2011S01463 M00021care employers are reporting difficulties in recruiting and retaining
2011S01463 M00022registered nurses and other health care staff. Due to this growing
2011S01463 M00023shortage of nurses in our state, health care facilities face the
2011S01463 M00024prospect of shrinking staffs just as the estimated 78 million baby
2011S01463 M00025boomers begin to reach the age of 65. A loan forgiveness program
2011S01463 M00026would provide a much needed incentive for people to join the nursing
2011S01463 M00027profession and avert a possible health care crisis in our state.

2011S01464 M00035JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01464 M00036Recent news accounts have reported three fatal murders involving
2011S01464 M00037livery cab drivers that occurred between May 10 and August 23, 2009
2011S01464 M00038in the Bronx. Jose Pena-Seguira, 42 was shot once in the head inside
2011S01464 M00039his cab. He was pronounced dead in a hospital approximately thirty
2011S01464 M00040minutes later. Ndiaye Amadau, 46 was fatally shot in the chest in his
2011S01464 M00041cab. Roberto Pinta, 37 was shot three times in the back during what
2011S01464 M00042was reported as a failed robbery.
2011S01464 M00043
2011S01464 M00044A fourth cab driver, Pericles Salas, 32, was found shot in the head
2011S01464 M00045early on the morning of August 30,2009 in Yonkers, NY. His wife and
2011S01464 M00046young daughter survive him.
2011S01464 M00047
2011S01464 M00048No one deserves to work under such stressful conditions and no one
2011S01464 M00049should have to fear for his or life while simply trying to do a job.
2011S01464 M00050
2011S01464 M00051This legislation imposes a sentence of life imprisonment without
2011S01464 M00052parole upon conviction for the crime of aggravated murder of a cab or
2011S01464 M00053livery cab owner or employee, or the owner or employee of a grocery

2011S01465 M00004An act
2011S01465 M00005to amend the real property tax law, in relation to granting a real
2011S01465 M00006property tax exemption to nonprofit organizations that purchase real
2011S01465 M00007property after the taxable status date
2011S01465 M00008
2011S01465 M00009PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S01465 M00010To authorize local municipal corporations (after local law adopted) to
2011S01465 M00011accept and administer nonprofit tax exemption applications after the
2011S01465 M00012taxable status date under certain circumstances.
2011S01465 M00013
2011S01465 M00014SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01465 M00015This bill would provide, at the option of the locality, that when a
2011S01465 M00016not-for-profit organization purchases property after the taxable
2011S01465 M00017status date, it will be permitted to submit an application for a real
2011S01465 M00018property tax exemption to the assessor. This bill also establishes
2011S01465 M00019procedures to change the assessment roll and allow for the exemption
2011S01465 M00020benefits granted upon purchase of property after the taxable status
2011S01465 M00021date to be applied against the eligible individual's tax levy of the
2011S01465 M00022subsequent year. If the municipal corporation has received
2011S01465 M00023reimbursement for the tax credit owed to the not-for-profit
2011S01465 M00024organization, the tax credit shall be paid to the municipal
2011S01465 M00025corporation making the tax payment.
2011S01465 M00026
2011S01465 M00027JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01465 M00028Currently, nonprofit organizations that are eligible for a real
2011S01465 M00029property tax exemption do not receive it immediately, after the
2011S01465 M00030purchase of property.
2011S01465 M00031They must pay the full amount of taxes, in some cases up to almost two
2011S01465 M00032years after purchasing the property. Since the State has deemed it
2011S01465 M00033proper to immediately tax property sold by someone receiving a real
2011S01465 M00034property tax exemption to a purchaser not entitled to an exemption,
2011S01465 M00035it is equally proper to grant immediate exempt status to property
2011S01465 M00036purchased by a nonprofit organization eligible for real property tax
2011S01465 M00037exemption.

2011S01466 M00004An act
2011S01466 M00005to amend the general business law, in relation to the manner of the sale
2011S01466 M00006of airbags by motor vehicle dealers or manufacturers in certain cases
2011S01466 M00007
2011S01466 M00008PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S01466 M00009The purpose of this bill is to require airbags to be sold without such
2011S01466 M00010sale being tied into the sale of other goods and services.
2011S01466 M00011
2011S01466 M00012SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01466 M00013Motor vehicle dealers and manufacturers who offer for sale and
2011S01466 M00014installation an airbag, must offer such airbag as a standard feature
2011S01466 M00015of that model of automobile or as an option, the purchase of which
2011S01466 M00016does not require the purchase of other options, whether or not such
2011S01466 M00017airbag is also offered as part of a package of options.
2011S01466 M00018
2011S01466 M00019This section shall not apply to airbags required to be installed under
2011S01466 M00020federal law.
2011S01466 M00021
2011S01466 M00022A motor vehicle dealer shall not be in violation of this section i~
2011S01466 M00023the dealer, after due diligence, is unable to acquire from the
2011S01466 M00024manufacturer a vehicle equipped with airbags as an option without the
2011S01466 M00025purchase of a package of options.
2011S01466 M00026
2011S01466 M00027JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01466 M00028It is in the best interest of consumers that they be able to purchase
2011S01466 M00029safety features when purchasing a new motor vehicle. Some motor
2011S01466 M00030vehicle dealers offer airbags as an optional feature. However,
2011S01466 M00031airbags often can only be purchased within a package containing other
2011S01466 M00032goods and services. This bill would require motor vehicle dealers and
2011S01466 M00033manufacturers to offer as standard equipment or as an individual
2011S01466 M00034item, the sale and installation of airbags without requiring the
2011S01466 M00035consumer to purchase it as part of a package on new automobiles.
2011S01466 M00036
2011S01466 M00037This bill would not prohibit offering for sale airbags as part of a
2011S01466 M00038package, so long as the consumer is able to purchase airbags without
2011S01466 M00039requiring the purchase of a package.

2011S01467 M00006identification databank
2011S01467 M00007
2011S01467 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S01467 M00009This bill would increase the types of firearms that are to be
2011S01467 M00010included in the firearm ballistic identification database.
2011S01467 M00011
2011S01467 M00012SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01467 M00013Section 1 of the bill amends section 396-ff of the general business
2011S01467 M00014law to require that assault weapons, rifles and other long-barreled
2011S01467 M00015weapons be included in the state's ballistics identification databank.
2011S01467 M00016
2011S01467 M00017Section 2 makes the effective date of the act the sixtieth day after
2011S01467 M00018it becomes law.
2011S01467 M00019
2011S01467 M00020EXISTING LAW:
2011S01467 M00021Current law only requires that pistols and revolvers be included in
2011S01467 M00022the ballistics fingerprint database.
2011S01467 M00023
2011S01467 M00024JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01467 M00025Every gun leaves behind a unique pattern or distinctive fingerprint
2011S01467 M00026which is imparted onto any bullet or casing discharged from the weapon.
2011S01467 M00027When a gun crime is perpetrated using a gun purchased in New York
2011S01467 M00028state, these unique ballistics patterns can be used to track down
2011S01467 M00029and identify the owner of the weapon and increase the chances of law
2011S01467 M00030enforcement authorities being led to the shooter when property
2011S01467 M00031preserved and stored in the state's ballistics fingerprint database.
2011S01467 M00032Although New York is one of only two states to require the
2011S01467 M00033maintenance of a statewide ballistics fingerprint database, current
2011S01467 M00034law only mandates that the database include shell casing data for
2011S01467 M00035recently manufactured pistols and revolvers, not for assault weapons,
2011S01467 M00036rifles or other long-barreled weapons.
2011S01467 M00037This omission leaves a major void in the ballistics data base and,
2011S01467 M00038consequently, in the ability of law enforcement ability to track down
2011S01467 M00039and apprehend perpetrators who use either assault weapons, rifles or
2011S01467 M00040other long-barreled weapons in the commission of their crimes. Had
2011S01467 M00041the 2002 Washington, D.C. sniper attacks occurred in New York, local
2011S01467 M00042authorities would have been powerless under current law to identify
2011S01467 M00043the weapon or its owner, in spite of the existence of New York's
2011S01467 M00044statewide ballistics database. The heinous acts of the DC area
2011S01467 M00045sniper, plus the fact that rifles and shotguns are fast becoming
2011S01467 M00046criminal weapons of choice, all underscore the need for New York's
2011S01467 M00047current ballistics data base law
2011S01467 M00048to become more expansive and inclusive in the types of firearms that
2011S01467 M00049it covers. Because of the unfortunate reality of the accessibility of
2011S01467 M00050various deadly firearms and their frequent involvement in the
2011S01467 M00051commission of violent criminal acts, it would be a gross and glaring
2011S01467 M00052
2011S01467 M00053oversight not to amend the current law to require the inclusion of as
2011S01467 M00054many of these different types of deadly firearms as possible into the
2011S01467 M00055state's ballistics finger-print database. Ammunition is often the
2011S01467 M00056sole evidence left behind at a crime scene which links directly to
2011S01467 M00057the perpetrator; if law enforcement continues to be deprived of the
2011S01467 M00058available technology and means to harness and use this evidence, the
2011S01467 M00059safety of all our communities will continue to be compromised. There
2011S01467 M00060are countless firearms currently being purchased in our state and
2011S01467 M00061nation every day, and law enforcement authorities must be equipped to
2011S01467 M00062track down these weapons in the event they are used in. the
2011S01467 M00063commission of a crime. By expanding New York's ballistic
2011S01467 M00064fingerprinting law to include assault weapons, rifles and other
2011S01467 M00065long-barreled weapons, the Legislature will be implementing a
2011S01467 M00066much-needed and effective measure to close a glaring and dangerous
2011S01467 M00067loophole. It is incumbent upon the Legislature and the
2011S01467 M00068Governor to give law enforcement the best tools possible to continue
2011S01467 M00069the fight against crime and terrorism.

2011S01468 M00002
2011S01468 M00003TITLE OF BILL:
2011S01468 M00004An act
2011S01468 M00005to amend the general business law, in relation to requiring credit
2011S01468 M00006reporting agencies to furnish proof of identity theft to creditors upon
2011S01468 M00007debtor's request
2011S01468 M00008
2011S01468 M00009PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S01468 M00010To prevent victims of identity theft from continuing to prove that
2011S01468 M00011such a crime occurred by requiring credit bureaus to keep proof of
2011S01468 M00012such crime and furnish proof upon request.
2011S01468 M00013
2011S01468 M00014SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01468 M00015This bill adds a new section to Chapter 63, Section 380 of the general
2011S01468 M00016business law.
2011S01468 M00017
2011S01468 M00018Section 1 of the bill requires credit reporting agencies to keep all
2011S01468 M00019submitted documentation indicating proof of identity theft for seven
2011S01468 M00020years and to furnish such information to all creditors upon the
2011S01468 M00021request of the victim.
2011S01468 M00022
2011S01468 M00023Section 2 of the bill defines proof of identity theft as follows:
2011S01468 M00024
2011S01468 M00025a) a copy of a valid police report tiled by the victim alleging the
2011S01468 M00026crime of identity theft;
2011S01468 M00027
2011S01468 M00028b) a written statement by the victim claiming to be a victim of
2011S01468 M00029identity theft with respect to the specific debt being collected by
2011S01468 M00030the creditor.
2011S01468 M00031
2011S01468 M00032Section 3 of the bill defines a written statement to be as follows:
2011S01468 M00033
2011S01468 M00034a) a signed federal trade commission ID theft victim's affidavit;
2011S01468 M00035
2011S01468 M00036b) a written statement that certifies to be true under penalty of law
2011S01468 M00037that the victim is a victim of identity theft and did not incur the
2011S01468 M00038debt or authorize the use of the~r name or personal information for
2011S01468 M00039incurring the debt;
2011S01468 M00040
2011S01468 M00041Section 3 of the bill requires the following to contain or accompany
2011S01468 M00042the written statement with respect to the relevance of the debt:
2011S01468 M00043
2011S01468 M00044a) a copy of the victim's driver's license or state issued
2011S01468 M00045identification card, documentation of the residence of the victim at
2011S01468 M00046the time of the alleged debt; any available correspondence disputing
2011S01468 M00047the debt after transaction information has been provided to the victim;
2011S01468 M00048
2011S01468 M00049b) any information concerning who may have incurred the debt such as the
2011S01468 M00050identification of any person who the victim believes is responsible;
2011S01468 M00051
2011S01468 M00052c) a telephone number for contacting the victim concerning any
2011S01468 M00053additional information or questions, or direction that further
2011S01468 M00054communicates to the victim be in writing only;
2011S01468 M00055
2011S01468 M00056Section 4 defines the written certification as defined in Section 3 to
2011S01468 M00057be sufficient if it is substantially in the following form:
2011S01468 M00058
2011S01468 M00059"I certify the representation made are true, correct and contain no
2011S01468 M00060material omissions of fact" Date and Place (Signature)
2011S01468 M00061
2011S01468 M00062JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01468 M00063Usually when there has been a case of identity theft, the victim's
2011S01468 M00064personal information is used to open several different accounts.
2011S01468 M00065Those accounts are then utilized and not paid for, eventually ending
2011S01468 M00066up in collections. Collection action can occur immediately or take up
2011S01468 M00067to six and a half years before it is put on the victim's credit
2011S01468 M00068report. While there may be an instance in which the victim has found
2011S01468 M00069out about the debt via letter, phone call or reviewing a copy of
2011S01468 M00070their credit report and has disputed and proven to be a victim,
2011S01468 M00071because of the lag in collections, the information stolen may not get
2011S01468 M00072collected on from another creditor until years later, thereby leaving
2011S01468 M00073the victim to have to prove once again that they have been a victim
2011S01468 M00074of identity theft.
2011S01468 M00075
2011S01468 M00076This is an inconvenience for the victim and a burden that they
2011S01468 M00077shouldn't have to sustain as it is not their fault that there is a
2011S01468 M00078lag in collections. This bill would define what proof is needed in
2011S01468 M00079regards to proving identity theft as well as require that once proof
2011S01468 M00080has been established, that the credit bureau must keep the proof for
2011S01468 M00081a period of seven years and furnish it immediately to the credit.or
2011S01468 M00082upon the victim's request.

2011S01469 M00008
2011S01469 M00009PURPOSE:
2011S01469 M00010
2011S01469 M00011To ensure the cremains (the remains of a cremated body) of veterans
2011S01469 M00012are properly and respectfully disposed of if not claimed, allowing
2011S01469 M00013for proper acknowledgement of those who have served our nation.
2011S01469 M00014
2011S01469 M00015SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01469 M00016
2011S01469 M00017Section one re-letters paragraph (j) of section 1517 of the
2011S01469 M00018not-for-profit corporations law to paragraph (k), and a new paragraph
2011S01469 M00019(j) is added. The new paragraph (j) provides that qualified tax
2011S01469 M00020exempt veterans organizations or federally chartered veteran's
2011S01469 M00021service organization will be given the right to receive and
2011S01469 M00022respectfully dispose of the cremated remains of the unclaimed bodies
2011S01469 M00023of veterans, if such remains have not been claimed by a relative or
2011S01469 M00024friend of the deceased within a designated period after cremation has
2011S01469 M00025taken place.
2011S01469 M00026
2011S01469 M00027JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01469 M00028
2011S01469 M00029Millions of American service men and women have fought for the united
2011S01469 M00030States in two World Wars, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, the
2011S01469 M00031ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and numerous other small
2011S01469 M00032conflicts. Those same service men and women have also carried out
2011S01469 M00033humanitarian relief projects on behalf of the limited States in every
2011S01469 M00034comer of the world. Sadly, however, the remains of some of those
2011S01469 M00035heroes sit unclaimed and forgotten on the shelves in funeral homes,
2011S01469 M00036hospitals, prisons, crematories and other facilities. (See, e.g.,
2011S01469 M00037"Abandoned cremains of veterans laid to rest," TEANECK SUBURBANITE,
2011S01469 M00038August 20, 2009.) It is fitting we provide a way for the remains of
2011S01469 M00039those lost heroes to receive the respectful and honorable interment
2011S01469 M00040they deserve.
2011S01469 M00041
2011S01469 M00042In 2009, the states of New Jersey and Illinois enacted laws concerning
2011S01469 M00043the final disposition of the unclaimed remains of veterans' bodies
2011S01469 M00044after cremation. Sadly, New York has not yet adopted a similar policy
2011S01469 M00045to allow the brothers and sisters in service of our fallen heroes the
2011S01469 M00046ability to serve their former comrades one final time. It is time New
2011S01469 M00047York adopts the same policy.
2011S01469 M00048
2011S01469 M00049By allowing veteran's organizations to carry out the proper burial
2011S01469 M00050procedures, rather than allow the cremated remains of American
2011S01469 M00051
2011S01469 M00052veterans to lay abandoned for decades, we pay due respect to those
2011S01469 M00053who have served to protect the life and liberty of this nation.

2011S01470 M00012
2011S01470 M00013SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01470 M00014This bill would prohibit any person or business entity from filing
2011S01470 M00015with the State or any political subdivision or any division or
2011S01470 M00016department thereof, any personal identifying information which is not
2011S01470 M00017relevant and necessary to accomplish the purpose of the filing, or
2011S01470 M00018not required by state or federal law, rule or regulation.
2011S01470 M00019
2011S01470 M00020The bill would also require agencies that receive instruments for
2011S01470 M00021filing to post a prominent notice describing the above prohibition.
2011S01470 M00022Lastly, the bill would authorize the Attorney General to enforce the
2011S01470 M00023provisions of this section by seeking an injunction against a violator.
2011S01470 M00024
2011S01470 M00025JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01470 M00026This bill would protect the privacy of New York State residents by
2011S01470 M00027prohibiting the filing of unnecessary personal identifying
2011S01470 M00028information with government entities. Such filings are records to
2011S01470 M00029which the general public may obtain access. Often documents such as
2011S01470 M00030mortgages and judgments are filed with government entities for public
2011S01470 M00031purpose and contain personal information not required by the
2011S01470 M00032statutory filing requirements. While rare, there have been instances
2011S01470 M00033when copies of a person's drivers license and credit card were
2011S01470 M00034submitted as part of a filing. This sensitive information should not
2011S01470 M00035be publicly available. Furthermore, as more and more localities
2011S01470 M00036implement systems allowing for public access of records via the
2011S01470 M00037Internet, the need to ensure that vulnerable personal information in
2011S01470 M00038not included in such records is critical.
2011S01470 M00039
2011S01470 M00040As the incidence of identity theft continues to rise, it is essential
2011S01470 M00041that precautions are implemented to ensure that personal identifying
2011S01470 M00042information does not become available to unauthorized persons.

2011S01471 M00012arbitration clauses.
2011S01471 M00013
2011S01471 M00014SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01471 M00015This bill would require private arbitration organizations involved in
2011S01471 M00016consumer arbitration cases to make certain information regarding
2011S01471 M00017those cases available to the public on its website and on paper upon
2011S01471 M00018request.
2011S01471 M00019
2011S01471 M00020The information required to be disclosed for each consumer arbitration
2011S01471 M00021would include the name of the non-consumer party; the type of dispute
2011S01471 M00022involved; whether the consumer was the prevailing party; and on how
2011S01471 M00023many occasions, if any, the non-consumer party has previously been a
2011S01471 M00024party in an arbitration administered by the private arbitration
2011S01471 M00025organization. No private arbitration organization would have any
2011S01471 M00026liability for collecting/publishing, or distributing such information.
2011S01471 M00027
2011S01471 M00028The bill would provide for enforcement by the Attorney General of the
2011S01471 M00029arbitration information disclosure provisions, as well as the
2011S01471 M00030existing prohibition against the inclusion of mandatory arbitration
2011S01471 M00031clauses in certain consumer contracts. The Attorney General would be
2011S01471 M00032empowered to seek an injunction against violators and/or a civil
2011S01471 M00033penalty of up to $2/000 for each violation. Each contract offered and
2011S01471 M00034entered into in violation of the mandatory arbitration clause
2011S01471 M00035prohibition would constitute a separate violation.
2011S01471 M00036
2011S01471 M00037JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01471 M00038The proliferation of binding mandatory arbitration clauses in consumer
2011S01471 M00039contracts, including contracts for credit cards/ telephone service,
2011S01471 M00040home loans, health care and consumer goods, over the past twenty
2011S01471 M00041years has led to a significant increase in the number of consumer
2011S01471 M00042disputes referred to arbitration. The vast majority of these
2011S01471 M00043proceedings are handled by arbitrators working for private
2011S01471 M00044organizations that administer arbitration programs for private
2011S01471 M00045businesses.
2011S01471 M00046
2011S01471 M00047In recent years, consumer advocates have raised concerns regarding the
2011S01471 M00048fairness of private arbitration proceedings. Many advocates maintain
2011S01471 M00049that consumers may not be able to get a fair hearing since arbitrators
2011S01471 M00050have a financial incentive to rule in favor of the businesses paying
2011S01471 M00051for his or her services.
2011S01471 M00052
2011S01471 M00053According to a 2007 report issued by Public Citizen, between January
2011S01471 M000541, 2003, and March 31, 2007, arbitrators working for one of the
2011S01471 M00055largest private arbitration organizations ruled in favor of
2011S01471 M00056businesses in ninety-four percent of the cases involving California
2011S01471 M00057residents that it examined.
2011S01471 M00058
2011S01471 M00059The report also found that:
2011S01471 M00060
2011S01471 M00061* In one fiscal quarter, an arbitrator working for a large private
2011S01471 M00062arbitration organization handled eighty cases brought by banks
2011S01471 M00063against consumers, and ruled for the bank in all eighty cases. In all
2011S01471 M00064of the cases, except two, she gave the bank one hundred percent of
2011S01471 M00065the amount it claimed;
2011S01471 M00066
2011S01471 M00067* Another arbitrator working for a large private arbitration
2011S01471 M00068organization handled sixty-eight cases in a single day - an average
2011S01471 M00069of one every seven minutes, assuming an eight-hour day - and ruled
2011S01471 M00070for the business in every case, awarding one hundred percent of the
2011S01471 M00071claim. According to Public citizen, the same arbitrator is an
2011S01471 M00072attorney with his own practice serving business and corporate clients;
2011S01471 M00073
2011S01471 M00074* In several cases, arbitrators from a. large private arbitration
2011S01471 M00075organization entered awards in favor of a large national bank and
2011S01471 M00076other lenders against identity theft victims who did not, in fact,
2011S01471 M00077owe any debts;
2011S01471 M00078and
2011S01471 M00079
2011S01471 M00080* Arbitrators who rule against businesses and in favor of consumers
2011S01471 M00081have been known to be blackballed from serving as arbitrators in
2011S01471 M00082future cases.
2011S01471 M00083
2011S01471 M00084This bill would shed light on the private arbitration industry and
2011S01471 M00085provide for greater accountability for private arbitration
2011S01471 M00086organizations by requiring such organizations to collect and make
2011S01471 M00087available to the public basic data regarding the nature and outcome
2011S01471 M00088of consumer arbitrations. This would ensure that consumers who are
2011S01471 M00089given the choice of pursuing a claim in the courts or in arbitration
2011S01471 M00090are able to obtain access to relevant information, such as the
2011S01471 M00091number of cases a private arbitration organization has handled for a
2011S01471 M00092particular business and whether the business or the consumer won most
2011S01471 M00093of those cases. The bill would also help to improve fairness in
2011S01471 M00094arbitrations for consumer forced into arbitration pursuant to a
2011S01471 M00095contract containing a binding mandatory arbitration clause.

2011S01472 M00018
2011S01472 M00019SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01472 M00020The primary duties of the commission will be to
2011S01472 M00021investigate, evaluate and make recommendations with regard to the
2011S01472 M00022Problems of sexual misconduct in state correctional facilities. As
2011S01472 M00023such, the commission will make recommendations concerning any
2011S01472 M00024additional rules and regulations may be necessary to reduce the risk
2011S01472 M00025that correctional employees engage in unlawful and prohibited sexual
2011S01472 M00026contact with inmates.
2011S01472 M00027

2011S01472 M00035be appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly and one member shall be
2011S01472 M00036appointed by the Minority Leader of the Assembly.
2011S01472 M00037
2011S01472 M00038The goal of the commission is to investigate the problem of
2011S01472 M00039correctional employees engaging in unlawful and prohibited sexual
2011S01472 M00040contact with inmates and recommend measures to rectify such
2011S01472 M00041circumstances. An initial report shall be submitted by the commission

2011S01473 M00003TITLE OF BILL:
2011S01473 M00004An act
2011S01473 M00005to amend the domestic relations law, in relation to the establishment and
2011S01473 M00006use of a parent-mediation program for child custody disputes
2011S01473 M00007
2011S01473 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S01473 M00009To create a mediation program to parents who are involved in
2011S01473 M00010a child custody dispute.
2011S01473 M00011
2011S01473 M00012SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01473 M00013Amends the Domestic Relations Law (DRL) by
2011S01473 M00014adding a new Article 5-B, creating a parent-mediation program for
2011S01473 M00015custody disputes. § 76-d of this new article would establish a
2011S01473 M00016mediation process for custody disputes and § 76-e provides for
2011S01473 M00017training for mediators.
2011S01473 M00018
2011S01473 M00019JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01473 M00020This bill would allow parents who are involved in a
2011S01473 M00021custody dispute to resolve their conflicts in a neutral setting
2011S01473 M00022taking into consideration the best interests of the child (or
2011S01473 M00023children) involved in the dispute. This mediation program will allow
2011S01473 M00024sufficient time for all parties involved to receive orientation to
2011S01473 M00025the process, allow them to participate fully in the mediation
2011S01473 M00026program, and be able to develop a comprehensive parenting plan
2011S01473 M00027without unduly compromising each party's right to due process and a
2011S01473 M00028timely resolution of the issues.
2011S01473 M00029
2011S01473 M00030New York State Family Courts are inundated with child custody cases
2011S01473 M00031that are often very contentious. With the large influx of child
2011S01473 M00032custody cases within the court system, decisions may be made hastily
2011S01473 M00033and the best interests of the child (or children) involved may not be
2011S01473 M00034fully considered. This program allows for resolution outside of the
2011S01473 M00035courtroom, reducing the caseload burden on the court system.
2011S01473 M00036
2011S01473 M00037In addition to the custody disputes, the parents involved are often
2011S01473 M00038experiencing the emotional and financial stress associated with
2011S01473 M00039separation or divorce. The parent-mediation program offers an
2011S01473 M00040opportunity to settle child custody disputes amicably. It would allow
2011S01473 M00041parents the opportunity to gain more control over parental
2011S01473 M00042arrangements, as well as determining what is best for their child (or
2011S01473 M00043children). Working through the mediation process, outside of the
2011S01473 M00044courts, will help to reduce the stress already associated with this
2011S01473 M00045difficult situation.
2011S01473 M00046
2011S01473 M00047Child Custody mediation programs have been implemented in several
2011S01473 M00048states including California, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.
2011S01473 M00049Programs of this nature have proven to be successful in resolving
2011S01473 M00050parental disputes regarding child custody by offering a neutral
2011S01473 M00051
2011S01473 M00052setting where each person's right to due process and confidentiality
2011S01473 M00053is protected, and the needs of the children can be met.

2011S01474 M00004An act
2011S01474 M00005to amend the education law, in relation to exempting tuition payments
2011S01474 M00006from items

2011S01474 M00008
2011S01474 M00009PURPOSE:
2011S01474 M00010To exempt tuition payments from the types of expenditures used to
2011S01474 M00011determine total spending under a contingency school budget.
2011S01474 M00012
2011S01474 M00013SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01474 M00014This legislation would amend paragraph b of
2011S01474 M00015subdivision 4 of section 2023 of the education law by adding a new
2011S01474 M00016subparagraph (ix) thereto which exempts tuition payments made by
2011S01474 M00017school districts from the list of expenditures used in determining
2011S01474 M00018total spending under a contingency school budget.
2011S01474 M00019
2011S01474 M00020EXISTING LAW:
2011S01474 M00021Under existing law, tuition payments made by school
2011S01474 M00022districts are expenditures that are included in the calculation to
2011S01474 M00023determine total spending under a contingency school budget.
2011S01474 M00024
2011S01474 M00025JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01474 M00026When a school district's budget proposals are not
2011S01474 M00027approved by the voters the sole trustee, board of trustees, or board
2011S01474 M00028of education must adopt a contingency budget. The contingency budget,
2011S01474 M00029by law, is not permitted to exceed 4% increase in total spending over
2011S01474 M00030the district's total spending under the school district budget for
2011S01474 M00031the prior school year.
2011S01474 M00032
2011S01474 M00033The school district does not determine the payments made to another
2011S01474 M00034school district for tuition and therefore these payments could far
2011S01474 M00035exceed the 4% increase from the previous year's spending for which a
2011S01474 M00036school district is permitted to levy a tax for a contingency budget.
2011S01474 M00037The school district could conceivably find itself paying such sum to
2011S01474 M00038another school district that it would be left without any increase in
2011S01474 M00039monies to pay for necessary expenses. This legislation would exempt
2011S01474 M00040tuition payments, which a school district has no control in
2011S01474 M00041determining, from its contingency budget.

2011S01475 M00043JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01475 M00044Across the state, not willing to wait for the courts to
2011S01475 M00045move forward, municipalities and counties are taking proactive
2011S01475 M00046measures to protect their children from violent sexual predators by
2011S01475 M00047enacting residency requirement legislation to keep sex offenders away
2011S01475 M00048from children.
2011S01475 M00049
2011S01475 M00050We love our children and we aim to protect them. Recent court action
2011S01475 M00051has created the need
2011S01475 M00052
2011S01475 M00053for a uniform state standard from dangerous sexual predators. This
2011S01475 M00054statewide Child Safety Zone legislation would create this standard.

2011S01476 M00013
2011S01476 M00014SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01476 M00015Section one of the bill grants the
2011S01476 M00016commissioner, with approval of the director of the budget and the
2011S01476 M00017director of the division of veterans affairs, authority to acquire

2011S01476 M00020any time they are no longer used for veteran's services, in order
2011S01476 M00021that they may be used for veteran's purposes.
2011S01476 M00022
2011S01476 M00023Section two of this bill provides for an immediate effective date.
2011S01476 M00024
2011S01476 M00025JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01476 M00026The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Campus of the Department
2011S01476 M00027of Veteran's Affairs in Montrose, New York, is sacred ground. Many
2011S01476 M00028Veterans have resided at this facility and have known it as their
2011S01476 M00029only home for many years.
2011S01476 M00030
2011S01476 M00031Originally known as Crugers Point Park, the land was optioned to the
2011S01476 M00032Veterans' Administration by Westchester County Executive Herbert
2011S01476 M00033Gerlach on February 13, 1945 for the construction of the first
2011S01476 M00034Veterans' facility in the nation. This land was deeded for Veteran's
2011S01476 M00035services, and today is also home to the twenty-five acre New York
2011S01476 M00036State Veteran's Home at Montrose.
2011S01476 M00037
2011S01476 M00038One of seventy-two lands acquired by the Veterans' Administration for
2011S01476 M00039the purpose of constructing a V.A. Hospital-s, the Franklin Delano
2011S01476 M00040Roosevelt campus was unique to the Veterans' Administration
2011S01476 M00041construction program as the only departure from a main building
2011S01476 M00042design, and the campus was dedicated to memorialize President
2011S01476 M00043Franklin Delano Roosevelt upon its opening in 1949. Additionally, the
2011S01476 M00044campus occupies the original site of the Boscobel House, already
2011S01476 M00045placed on the National Register of Historic Places.
2011S01476 M00046
2011S01476 M00047In recent years, many of the critical services offered at this
2011S01476 M00048facility, which sits across the Hudson River from the united states
2011S01476 M00049Military Academy West Point and caters to one of the State's largest
2011S01476 M00050Veterans populations, have been moved to other facilities and
2011S01476 M00051portions of the campus have fallen into disrepair.
2011S01476 M00052
2011S01476 M00053Sitting on what is perhaps the last prime, undeveloped riverfront
2011S01476 M00054property along the Hudson River within thirty miles of New York City,
2011S01476 M00055in recent times, Montrose has attracted the gaze of developers who
2011S01476 M00056seek to make use of the Enhanced Use Lease provision of the United
2011S01476 M00057States Code. One proposal left only 12 acres out of the 184 total
2011S01476 M00058acres for Veteran's services.
2011S01476 M00059
2011S01476 M00060We cannot ask those who have given so much for us all, and their
2011S01476 M00061families, to travel long distances for these services elsewhere in
2011S01476 M00062order to construct luxury condominiums. This land should remain
2011S01476 M00063sacred ground, forever used for Veteran's services, as was originally
2011S01476 M00064intended.
2011S01476 M00065
2011S01476 M00066Any development to the ground should be earmarked solely for veterans.
2011S01476 M00067This legislation would authorize the Commissioner of Health to
2011S01476 M00068acquire those portions of the site no longer used for Veteran's
2011S01476 M00069services to ensure the majority of the land will be kept, and
2011S01476 M00070increased for Veteran's medical and other services, job training,
2011S01476 M00071education, new skills development and more services for women Veterans.

2011S01477 M00026JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01477 M00027Officer Michael Perry suffered a fatal
2011S01477 M00028heart attack
2011S01477 M00029shortly after chasing and arresting a man at a local mall near state
2011S01477 M00030route 127. He had called for assistance and chased the larceny
2011S01477 M00031suspect a short distance before placing him into custody.
2011S01477 M00032
2011S01477 M00033Officer Perry transported the man to police headquarters for booking
2011S01477 M00034when he suddenly collapsed. He was transported to White plains
2011S01477 M00035Hospital where he passed away a short time later. The suspect, who
2011S01477 M00036was a career criminal with over 300 arrests, was charged with
2011S01477 M00037resisting arrest and larceny.
2011S01477 M00038
2011S01477 M00039A resident of Yorktown, Officer Perry had served with the White Plains

2011S01477 M00043Officer Perry was posthumously promoted to the rank of police
2011S01477 M00044Detective.
2011S01477 M00045

2011S01479 M00009PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S01479 M00010
2011S01479 M00011To establish a licensing requirement of immigration consultants by the
2011S01479 M00012state and to protect immigrants from fraudulent immigration
2011S01479 M00013consultants.
2011S01479 M00014
2011S01479 M00015SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01479 M00016
2011S01479 M00017The bill amends General Business Article 28-C (Chapter 463).
2011S01479 M00018
2011S01479 M00019This legislation would grant New York State Department the power to
2011S01479 M00020issue licenses to immigration providers and require those who act as
2011S01479 M00021such to be so licensed. Licensees would be required to disclose all
2011S01479 M00022relevant information to the Department, including any prior
2011S01479 M00023convictions, to determine their eligibility for a license. At the
2011S01479 M00024time of licensing, they must file with secretary of state a surety
2011S01479 M00025bond.
2011S01479 M00026
2011S01479 M00027In addition, licensees would be required to display the license
2011S01479 M00028certificate and to pay a filing fee. The state also has to make
2011S01479 M00029public the list of licensees on its website and upon the re-lest of
2011S01479 M00030any party.
2011S01479 M00031
2011S01479 M00032The State should also establish a procedure for filing complaints and
2011S01479 M00033investigating the complaint within 30 days of such a complaint. The
2011S01479 M00034Department of State has the power to revoke or suspend such licenses
2011S01479 M00035upon proof of wrongdoing on the part of the immigration provider.
2011S01479 M00036
2011S01479 M00037Any persons aggrieved by the immigration consultants would be entitled
2011S01479 M00038to relief in the form of a civil action as well as a criminal action.
2011S01479 M00039The injured party would be eligible for reasonable attorney fees and
2011S01479 M00040costs, including a minimal recovery of five thousand dollars.
2011S01479 M00041
2011S01479 M00042JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01479 M00043
2011S01479 M00044Currently, there are laws that prohibit immigration providers to
2011S01479 M00045conduct themselves and advertise themselves as lawyers. However,
2011S01479 M00046there is no state regulation of these providers. As the growth of
2011S01479 M00047immigrants increase, there is a great need for legislation to prevent
2011S01479 M00048immigration providers from taking advantage of these immigrants. Such
2011S01479 M00049legislation would act as a safeguard against those who practice
2011S01479 M00050fraudulent activities
2011S01479 M00051against immigrants for mere economic gains. Furthermore, the
2011S01479 M00052
2011S01479 M00053business of immigration consultants is virtually unregulated by the
2011S01479 M00054state.
2011S01479 M00055
2011S01479 M00056The state legislation should take active measures to protect against
2011S01479 M00057corrupt practices by immigration consultants. These consultants try
2011S01479 M00058to deprive immigrants of the fundamental liberties which they seek to
2011S01479 M00059achieve as citizens of our country. Also, corrupt immigration
2011S01479 M00060consultants create a negative first impression of the democratic
2011S01479 M00061process by using the immigrants for their own selfish profits at the
2011S01479 M00062expense of unwary immigrants. This legislation seeks to regulate the
2011S01479 M00063business of immigration consultants and to protect immigrants from
2011S01479 M00064those who do not have the requisite expertise in or commitment to
2011S01479 M00065that business.

2011S01480 M00003TITLE OF BILL:
2011S01480 M00004An act
2011S01480 M00005to amend the general business law and the public service law, in
2011S01480 M00006relation to the provision of residential wireless telephone service
2011S01480 M00007
2011S01480 M00008PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S01480 M00009This bill enacts the "wireless telephone consumer protection act"
2011S01480 M00010providing consumer protections such as disclosure of terms and
2011S01480 M00011conditions of services and charges.
2011S01480 M00012
2011S01480 M00013SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01480 M00014Section 1 of the bill is the short title.
2011S01480 M00015
2011S01480 M00016Section 2 of the bill is the statement of legislative findings and
2011S01480 M00017purpose.
2011S01480 M00018
2011S01480 M00019Section 3 of the bill amends the General Business Law by adding a new
2011S01480 M00020section 398-e, which establishes wireless telephone fair practices,
2011S01480 M00021and a complaint process with the Consumer Protection Board. New GBL
2011S01480 M00022§398-e has 8 subdivisions. Subdivision 1 sets out definitions.
2011S01480 M00023Subdivision 2 requires disclosure of calling plans, monthly fees,
2011S01480 M00024airtime minutes, additional charges, termination fees, length of
2011S01480 M00025trial periods, E-911 service, and coverage maps and areas. It also
2011S01480 M00026requires a good faith estimate of the anticipated total monthly bill.
2011S01480 M00027Subdivision 3 requires clearly organized wireless bills with billing
2011S01480 M00028that is done in plain language.
2011S01480 M00029
2011S01480 M00030Subdivision 4 of new GBL §398-e requires a trial use period of fifteen
2011S01480 M00031days after the first monthly bill has been issued. A customer may
2011S01480 M00032cancel within the fifteen day trial period without a termination fee.
2011S01480 M00033Subdivision 5 gives the Consumer Protection Board's executive
2011S01480 M00034director authority to receive and resolve consumer complaints,
2011S01480 M00035subpoena power, and authority to assess civil penalties for
2011S01480 M00036violations. Subdivisions 6, 7 and 8 provide for reporting,
2011S01480 M00037applicability and severability.
2011S01480 M00038
2011S01480 M00039Section 4 of the bill amends paragraph (a) of subdivision 6 of section
2011S01480 M000405 of the Public Service Law.
2011S01480 M00041
2011S01480 M00042Section 5 of the bill is the effective date.
2011S01480 M00043
2011S01480 M00044JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01480 M00045The rapid development of wireless telephone technologies has increased
2011S01480 M00046the affordability and use of the services, and as a result, many
2011S01480 M00047consumers
2011S01480 M00048now use cell phones as a primary mode of communication. Many other
2011S01480 M00049customers, especially older ones, use cell phones primarily for
2011S01480 M00050safety in the event of emergencies during travel. The wireless
2011S01480 M00051industry has evolved to the point where different providers offer
2011S01480 M00052
2011S01480 M00053various calling plans, rates and other services. However, many
2011S01480 M00054consumers find the plethora of plans confusing and providers do not
2011S01480 M00055always fully disclose the terms of service. Lack of full disclosure
2011S01480 M00056can make it difficult to evaluate calling plans or to compare
2011S01480 M00057different plans. Moreover, wireless plans often lock consumers into
2011S01480 M00058long term contracts with high cancellation costs.
2011S01480 M00059
2011S01480 M00060The Wireless Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the Act) will give the
2011S01480 M00061Consumer Protection Board authority to regulate wireless telephone
2011S01480 M00062service providers with respect to consumer protections, to establish
2011S01480 M00063and administer a consumer complaint resolution process, and to assess
2011S01480 M00064administrative penalties for noncompliance with the Act or
2011S01480 M00065implementing regulations or orders. The legislation would also
2011S01480 M00066provide specific protections for consumers, including the right to
2011S01480 M00067cancel service without any termination fees within 15 days after the
2011S01480 M00068first wireless telephone bill has been issued to the customer. This
2011S01480 M00069provision would give a meaningful remedy to the customer who receives
2011S01480 M00070a bill that is significantly higher than expected, or advertised. The
2011S01480 M00071Act would require providers to disclose detailed coverage showing
2011S01480 M00072where cell phone service is and is not available, a significant issue
2011S01480 M00073for customers who buy cell phones for safety when driving. Other
2011S01480 M00074protections include: requiring upfront disclosure of monthly fees,
2011S01480 M00075taxes, surcharges and additional charges for using the cell phone, a
2011S01480 M00076formal consumer complaint process at the Consumer Protection Board,
2011S01480 M00077information regarding basic and enhanced wireless 911 service, good
2011S01480 M00078faith estimates of anticipated monthly
2011S01480 M00079bills, and clearly organized bills written in plain language.
2011S01480 M00080
2011S01480 M00081In March 2006, the Assembly Committee on Consumer Affairs and
2011S01480 M00082Protection held a public hearing at which both industry and consumer
2011S01480 M00083representatives testified, as did a representative of the New York
2011S01480 M00084State Consumer Protection Board (the CPB). As part of his overview,
2011S01480 M00085the CPB representative noted that in 2004, the latest year for which
2011S01480 M00086data had been published, the Better Business Bureau reported that it
2011S01480 M00087received more complaints about wireless telephone service than it did
2011S01480 M00088for any other industry. Similarly, the National Association of
2011S01480 M00089Attorneys General reported that surveys over the past five years
2011S01480 M00090showed that complaints about wireless service were among the most
2011S01480 M00091frequently occurring categories of complaints. The CPB
2011S01480 M00092representative also noted that at the CPB the volume of complaints
2011S01480 M00093about wireless service had remained steady for the last several
2011S01480 M00094years, both in terms of absolute numbers and percentage of
2011S01480 M00095complaints. He estimated that two-thirds of consumer complaints
2011S01480 M00096concern billing or rate issues, with the remaining complaints
2011S01480 M00097concerning quality of service, dissatisfaction with industry
2011S01480 M00098responses to inquiries or complaints, and general lack of information
2011S01480 M00099about how and where to file a consumer complaint. With respect to
2011S01480 M00000.SO DOC S 1480                                   MTXT                 2011
2011S01480 M00100billing, one
2011S01480 M001010 f the most common complaints has been that rates and fees are higher
2011S01480 M00102than consumers understood they would be at the time of purchase. As
2011S01480 M00103noted above, the specific provisions of the Act, especially up front
2011S01480 M00104disclosure, a formal consumer complaint process at the CPB, and the
2011S01480 M00105
2011S01480 M00106trial period ending 15 days after the first bill to the consumer,
2011S01480 M00107would address a substantial majority of the complaints described at
2011S01480 M00108the 2006 hearing.

2011S01481 M00007
2011S01481 M00008SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01481 M00009Adds a new §2 to §214-m of the Agriculture and Markets Law which
2011S01481 M00010requires manufacturers and distributors of dietary and nutritional
2011S01481 M00011supplements to clearly indicate on the package whether the product
2011S01481 M00012has been tested by the FDA.
2011S01481 M00013
2011S01481 M00014JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01481 M00015Diet and nutritional supplements are being sold in pharmacies, grocery
2011S01481 M00016stores, as well as health food establishments. Some manufacturers
2011S01481 M00017voluntarily choose to have their products tested by the FDA to insure
2011S01481 M00018the integrity of the product. Others do not.
2011S01481 M00019
2011S01481 M00020This bill is intended to allow the consumer to know which products
2011S01481 M00021have been tested so that a more informed choice can be made when
2011S01481 M00022purchasing these various products. This bill deals only with the
2011S01481 M00023analysis of the product for purity. It does not deal with any
2011S01481 M00024medicinal attributes of the product.

2011S01482 M00007
2011S01482 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S01482 M00009The purpose of this bill is to authorize employees to take up to two
2011S01482 M00010hours off from work, without loss of pay in order to vote. Entitles
2011S01482 M00011employees to take time off from work for the entire day, without pay,
2011S01482 M00012in order to serve as an election officer or poll watcher, or to
2011S01482 M00013campaign for a candidate or ballot measure. Provides that no employer
2011S01482 M00014shall refuse an employee the right to take time off on election day,
2011S01482 M00015or discharge or threaten to discharge an employee or subject an
2011S01482 M00016employee to a penalty, because the employee tries to exercise or
2011S01482 M00017enforce this right.
2011S01482 M00018
2011S01482 M00019SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01482 M00020This bill adds a new Article 32 of the labor law to include sections
2011S01482 M00021930, 931 and 932.
2011S01482 M00022
2011S01482 M00023JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01482 M00024Currently, employees must find the time to vote in elections either
2011S01482 M00025before their work hours begin or after they have concluded. This
2011S01482 M00026limits voters' accessibility to the polls, as they attempt to find
2011S01482 M00027the time to vote during time periods in which they must care for
2011S01482 M00028their children and families or before many of their children attend
2011S01482 M00029school. This legislation would eradicate this problem by authorizing
2011S01482 M00030employees to take up to two hours off from work on election days,
2011S01482 M00031without sustaining a loss of income. This legislation would also seek
2011S01482 M00032to enfranchise voters by allowing them to take off one day of work,
2011S01482 M00033without pay, in order to serve as election officers or poll watchers,
2011S01482 M00034or to campaign for any candidate or ballot measure.

2011S01483 M00016
2011S01483 M00017This section states that an employer must grant an employee leave of
2011S01483 M00018up to a total of sixteen hours during any school year to attend
2011S01483 M00019school conferences or classroom activities related to the employee's
2011S01483 M00020child that cannot be scheduled during non-work hours. The section
2011S01483 M00021also outlines notification and verification procedures, leave limits
2011S01483 M00022and employee rights under this act.
2011S01483 M00023
2011S01483 M00024JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01483 M00025Studies have shown that children whose parents are actively involved
2011S01483 M00026in their education are more likely to succeed academically. As a
2011S01483 M00027result, it is important to ensure that parents have an opportunity to
2011S01483 M00028attend school related functions that occur during regular business
2011S01483 M00029hours, including parent-teacher conferences.

2011S01484 M00007government
2011S01484 M00008
2011S01484 M00009SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01484 M00010Section One. The president of the state civil service commission
2011S01484 M00011within the department of civil service is hereby directed to study
2011S01484 M00012and publish annual reports recording data relating to diversity
2011S01484 M00013within the state and civil divisions thereof as well as appointments
2011S01484 M00014to all state agencies, authorities, boards, bureaus, commissions,
2011S01484 M00015departments and divisions.
2011S01484 M00016The president of the state civil service commission shall annually
2011S01484 M00017publish such reports and findings. Such reports shall be sent to the
2011S01484 M00018chair of the senate standing committee on investigations and
2011S01484 M00019government operations and to the chair of the assembly standing
2011S01484 M00020committee on governmental employees no later than the first of
2011S01484 M00021February in each year.
2011S01484 M00022
2011S01484 M00023JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01484 M00024In previous years the State Civil Service commission published data
2011S01484 M00025relating to diversity within the State Civil service system. For
2011S01484 M00026reasons left unexplained, the Commission has stopped publishing such
2011S01484 M00027reports, thereby leaving the State Legislature uninformed regarding
2011S01484 M00028the statistical makeup of the Civil service sector.
2011S01484 M00029
2011S01484 M00030This legislation also requires publication of this data in addition to
2011S01484 M00031data previously unrecorded. This bill also requires for the
2011S01484 M00032acquisition and publication of data from all sectors of the State
2011S01484 M00033Government, including appointments. It simply seeks solid data which
2011S01484 M00034can be used to measure minority and women hirings by the New York
2011S01484 M00035State Government.
2011S01484 M00036
2011S01484 M00037A recent study by the Center for Women in Government, entitled
2011S01484 M00038'Democracy unrealized', has shown that Policy Level appointees within
2011S01484 M00039the State of New York are grossly devoid of both minorities and
2011S01484 M00040women. out of sixty-three (63) policy level appointees, only eighteen
2011S01484 M00041(18) are women and of that eighteen only three (3) are persons of
2011S01484 M00042African-American or Latino background. Of the remaining forty-five
2011S01484 M00043(45) male appointees, only four (4) are men of African-American or
2011S01484 M00044Latino backgrounds.
2011S01484 M00045Conspicuously absent from these appointments are persons of Asian or
2011S01484 M00046Native American backgrounds. This leaves New York State, one of the
2011S01484 M00047most diverse states in the Nation, with one of the lowest races of
2011S01484 M00048diversity for Policy-Level appointees.
2011S01484 M00049
2011S01484 M00050This legislation seeks not to remedy this gross lack of diversity, but
2011S01484 M00051to obtain data that can be used to study and mediate this problem in
2011S01484 M00052the future.

2011S01485 M00006services by state agencies
2011S01485 M00007
2011S01485 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S01485 M00009This legislation would ensure that limited English proficient New
2011S01485 M00010Yorkers have access to services provided by state agencies through
2011S01485 M00011the provision of interpreters and translated material.
2011S01485 M00012
2011S01485 M00013SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01485 M00014Section 1 amends the civil service law by adding section 55-d. This
2011S01485 M00015section requires that every state agency provide language assistance
2011S01485 M00016services to all limited English proficient individuals so as to
2011S01485 M00017ensure that all such individuals who cannot read, write or understand
2011S01485 M00018the English language with the proficiency necessary for adequate
2011S01485 M00019communication with agency personnel have effective access to the
2011S01485 M00020agency's primary programs and services. Language assistance services
2011S01485 M00021for primary and non-primary languages shall be available at all
2011S01485 M00022agency locations open for public business, and shall, to the extent
2011S01485 M00023practicable, be provided in person. Translation of all frequently
2011S01485 M00024used forms, and other written materials that are essential to access
2011S01485 M00025agency services shall be available in all of the agency's primary
2011S01485 M00026languages.
2011S01485 M00027
2011S01485 M00028Section 2: requires all agencies to provide written notice as to the
2011S01485 M00029availability of language assistance services, including oral
2011S01485 M00030interpretation and translations of forms and other materials. This
2011S01485 M00031notice shall also be posted in conspicuous agency locations open for
2011S01485 M00032public business, in all primary languages.
2011S01485 M00033
2011S01485 M00034Section 3: requires that all agencies maintain a record of the primary
2011S01485 M00035languages spoken by any individual seeking or receiving language
2011S01485 M00036assistance services at such agency.
2011S01485 M00037
2011S01485 M00038Section 4a: requires all agencies to submit an annual report assessing
2011S01485 M00039its compliance with the requirements of this section.

2011S01485 M00047year, a written report on agency compliance with the requirements of
2011S01485 M00048this section.
2011S01485 M00049
2011S01485 M00050Section 5: the president shall promulgate rules and regulations as may
2011S01485 M00051be necessary and proper to implement the provisions of this section,
2011S01485 M00052
2011S01485 M00053which shall include the methodology to be used by agencies in

2011S01485 M00056Section 6: Definitions.
2011S01485 M00057
2011S01485 M00058JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01485 M00059Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that no person in
2011S01485 M00060the united States shall on the ground of race, color or national
2011S01485 M00061origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of,
2011S01485 M00062or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity
2011S01485 M00063receiving federal assistance. The united states Department of Justice
2011S01485 M00064has stated that failure to provide language assistance to limited
2011S01485 M00065English speaking individuals in federally funded, state supervised or
2011S01485 M00066administered programs amounts to a violation of Title VI by
2011S01485 M00067discriminating against such individuals based upon their national
2011S01485 M00068origin.
2011S01485 M00069
2011S01485 M00070This legislation would ensure that New York state and county
2011S01485 M00071governments are in compliance with Title VI by requiring the
2011S01485 M00072provision of translated materials and. interpreters to limited
2011S01485 M00073English speaking persons seeking assistance and services.
2011S01485 M00074
2011S01485 M00075This bill tries to address the need for translation services at state
2011S01485 M00076and county offices. Many limited English proficient New Yorkers fail
2011S01485 M00077to receive adequate services due to failure to comply with Title VI
2011S01485 M00078regulations.

2011S01487 M00011
2011S01487 M00012PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF THE BILL:
2011S01487 M00013The establishment of credit education courses for college students
2011S01487 M00014interested becoming card holders.
2011S01487 M00015
2011S01487 M00016SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01487 M00017Amends the banking law by adding section 9500 to prohibit the State
2011S01487 M00018University of New York from permitting the solicitation of credit
2011S01487 M00019cards on campuses to enrolled students unless credit education
2011S01487 M00020courses are provided. Amends the banking law by adding section 9501
2011S01487 M00021to prohibit the City University of New York from permitting the
2011S01487 M00022solicitation of credit cards on campuses to enrolled students unless
2011S01487 M00023credit education courses are provided. Amends the education law by
2011S01487 M00024adding section 355-d to prohibit the State University of New York
2011S01487 M00025from permitting the solicitation of credit cards on campuses to
2011S01487 M00026enrolled students unless credit education courses are provided.
2011S01487 M00027Amends the education law by adding section 6204-b to prohibit the
2011S01487 M00028City University of New York from permitting the solicitation of
2011S01487 M00029credit cards on campuses to enrolled students unless credit education
2011S01487 M00030courses are provided.
2011S01487 M00031
2011S01487 M00032JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01487 M00033With the rising cost of tuition at SUNY and CUNY campuses, sound
2011S01487 M00034budgetary spending by enrolled students is more important than ever
2011S01487 M00035before.
2011S01487 M00036Many students on State and City University campuses acquire credit
2011S01487 M00037cards because there is an open door policy permitting solicitation.
2011S01487 M00038Credit card companies target young college students because of their
2011S01487 M00039necessity to purchase numerous goods and services throughout their
2011S01487 M00040educational experience. More often than not, these credit card
2011S01487 M00041solicitors fail to warn college students of the responsibilities
2011S01487 M00042involved with being credit card holders. We believe this is
2011S01487 M00043unacceptable negligence on the part of the credit card solicitors.
2011S01487 M00044The goal of this bill is to educate young college students about
2011S01487 M00045credit awareness and the repercussions of falling into credit
2011S01487 M00046indebtedness. It is our hope that credit education courses become a
2011S01487 M00047mandatory element in qualification for students of both SUNY and CUNY
2011S01487 M00048campuses requesting to become credit card holders, for their own
2011S01487 M00049protection.

2011S01489 M00004
2011S01489 M00005An act
2011S01489 M00006to amend the executive law, in relation to establishing the "protection
2011S01489 M00007of victims of domestic violence act"
2011S01489 M00008
2011S01489 M00009PURPOSE:
2011S01489 M00010
2011S01489 M00011The purpose of this legislation is to release defendants under
2011S01489 M00012protective conditions, which mayor may not include a global device in
2011S01489 M00013efforts to protect the welfare of the victim. Under these conditions
2011S01489 M00014of release, the defendant who is charged with a crime involving
2011S01489 M00015domestic violence shall be monitored by a global positioning system.
2011S01489 M00016
2011S01489 M00017SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01489 M00018
2011S01489 M00019Section one of the act amends the executive law by adding a new
2011S01489 M00020article 22-A, containing sections 636 and 637 of said law.
2011S01489 M00021
2011S01489 M00022Section 636 of the executive law provides that this legislation shall
2011S01489 M00023be entitled "the protection of victims of domestic violence act.
2011S01489 M00024
2011S01489 M00025Section 637 of the executive law provides that if a judge releases a
2011S01489 M00026defendant charged with domestic violence, who is subject to
2011S01489 M00027conditions reasonably necessary to protect one or more named persons
2011S01489 M00028and such conditions are made part of a protective order, he or she
2011S01489 M00029shall be subject to arrest without a warrant and/or may have his/her
2011S01489 M00030bail forfeited or revoked if such conditions are violated.
2011S01489 M00031
2011S01489 M00032Section 637 additionally provides that a court may order a defendant
2011S01489 M00033in a domestic violence proceeding to carry or wear a global
2011S01489 M00034positioning system (GPS) device as a condition of his/her release
2011S01489 M00035and, upon the informed consent of the victim, the court may require
2011S01489 M00036such defendant to provide the victim with a receptor device capable
2011S01489 M00037of notifying the victim if the defendant is in proximity to such
2011S01489 M00038victim (as is determined by the judge in consultation with the
2011S01489 M00039victim). The GPS device shall be paid for by the defendant, unless
2011S01489 M00040such defendant opts to perform community service instead of paying
2011S01489 M00041for such device.
2011S01489 M00042
2011S01489 M00043Finally, section 637 explicitly does not limit the ability of the
2011S01489 M00044judge to impose other protective or release conditions allowed under
2011S01489 M00045other areas of the law.
2011S01489 M00046
2011S01489 M00047JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01489 M00048
2011S01489 M00049According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the
2011S01489 M00050National Institute of Justice, 25% of women have experienced domestic
2011S01489 M00051violence in their lifetime. (See, Patricia Tjaden & Nancy Thoennes,
2011S01489 M00052
2011S01489 M00053EXTENT, NATURE AND CONSEQUENCES OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE, findings
2011S01489 M00054from the National Violence Against Women Study, USDOJ, National
2011S01489 M00055Institutes of Justice, Center for Disease Control, July 2000.)
2011S01489 M00056Estimates range from 960,000 incidents of violence against a current
2011S01489 M00057or former spouse, boyfriend or girlfriend, to as many as 1.3 million
2011S01489 M00058women who are physically abused by an intimate partner each year.
2011S01489 M00059
2011S01489 M00060(See, U.S. Department of Justice, Violence by Intimates: Analysis of
2011S01489 M00061Data On Crimes by Current or Former Spouses, Boyfriends and
2011S01489 M00062Girlfriends, March 1998.) Nearly 81% of women stalked by a current or
2011S01489 M00063former intimate partner are also physically assaulted by that person,
2011S01489 M00064and roughly 31% are also sexually assaulted by that person. (See,
2011S01489 M00065Patricia Tjaden & Nancy Thoennes, "Stalking in America," National
2011S01489 M00066Institute for Justice (1998). Finally, the estimated cost of intimate
2011S01489 M00067partner violence exceeds $5.8 billion each year, more than 70% of
2011S01489 M00068which is for direct medical and mental health services. (See, "Costs
2011S01489 M00069of intimate partner Violence Against Women in the United States,"
2011S01489 M000702003, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)
2011S01489 M00071
2011S01489 M00072Domestic violence affects hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers
2011S01489 M00073annually. Each year, an estimated 400,000 domestic violence incidents
2011S01489 M00074are reported to law enforcement in New York, and roughly 300,000
2011S01489 M00075calls are received by hotlines throughout the State.
2011S01489 M00076
2011S01489 M00077Domestic violence is also a chronically under reported crime. While
2011S01489 M00078there are many theories, one possibility is a perception that the
2011S01489 M00079necessary precautions needed to protect victims of domestic violence
2011S01489 M00080are insufficient, or rarely implemented in a comprehensive manner.
2011S01489 M00081One example is the use of orders of protection, which are often
2011S01489 M00082unable to adequately protect individuals (and their children) from
2011S01489 M00083abuse, which creates a sense of helplessness and leads to unreported
2011S01489 M00084incident.
2011S01489 M00085
2011S01489 M00086(See http://www.ncadv.org/files/New%20York%20new%202.09.pdf).
2011S01489 M00087Furthermore, after the victims seek the protection of the police or
2011S01489 M00088courts, their batterers often lash out at the victim in what is
2011S01489 M00089labeled retribution assault." There is an obvious need, therefore, to
2011S01489 M00090close this gap in the protection extended to victims of domestic
2011S01489 M00091violence.
2011S01489 M00092
2011S01489 M00093There are currently 387 monitoring devices in use within New York
2011S01489 M00094State by the Division of Parole. Five are older technology radio
2011S01489 M00095frequency identification (RFID) devices, and 382 are Global
2011S01489 M00096Positioning System (GPS) devices. These GPS devices have multiple
2011S01489 M00097uses, among which is the monitoring of sexual offenders and parolees
2011S01489 M00098and, potentially, domestic violence offenders.

2011S01489 M00100The use of GPS technology to track domestic abusers has been
2011S01489 M00101implemented, or is in the process of being adopted, by multiple
2011S01489 M00102states, including California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana,
2011S01489 M00103Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Washington, and
2011S01489 M00104
2011S01489 M00105the District of Columbia. (See, Maura Kelly, "Tracking Device: How
2011S01489 M00106about using GPS monitoring to stop batterers?" Slate, May 4, 2007.)
2011S01489 M00107
2011S01489 M00108In Massachusetts, judges have statutory authority to order offenders who
2011S01489 M00109have violated an order of protection to wear a GPS device. (See H.B.
2011S01489 M0011030, 184th Gen. Ct., Reg. Sess. (Mass 200S), cited in Diane L.
2011S01489 M00111Rosenfeld, "Correlative Rights and the Boundaries of Freedom:
2011S01489 M00112Protecting the Civil Rights of Endangered Women," 43 Harv.
2011S01489 M00113C.R.-C.L.L. Rev. 2S7, 261 (2008).
2011S01489 M00114The legislation also allows judges "to establish as a condition of
2011S01489 M00115probation, geographic exclusion zones, which can include the victim's
2011S01489 M00116residence, place of work, children's schools, or other places
2011S01489 M00117frequented by the victim." (Rosenfeld, Id. at 261.)
2011S01489 M00118
2011S01489 M00119Although it is difficult to generalize, the Massachusetts experiment
2011S01489 M00120with GPS tracking of domestic abusers has reportedly shown very
2011S01489 M00121positive results. Between 200S and 2007, domestic violence linked
2011S01489 M00122homicides increased 300%, but in the city of Newburyport, where the
2011S01489 M00123most concentrated effort to use GPS tracking has been implemented,
2011S01489 M00124there were no such homicides during those two years. (See, Ariana
2011S01489 M00125Green, "More States Use GPS to Track Abusers," The New York Times,
2011S01489 M00126May 9, 2009, http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/09/us/09gps.html? r=l).
2011S01489 M00127Such a result implies the need for New York to adopt such a program
2011S01489 M00128with regard to domestic abusers.
2011S01489 M00129
2011S01489 M00130The effectiveness of GPS tracking of domestic violence perpetrators
2011S01489 M00131can be enhanced by instituting bilateral monitoring as an additional
2011S01489 M00132safeguard for victims of domestic violence. (See, Edna Erez, Peter R.
2011S01489 M00133Ibarry, Norman Lurie, "Electronic Monitoring of Domestic Violence
2011S01489 M00134Cases A Study of Two Bilateral Programs," 68-Jun Fed. Probation IS
2011S01489 M00135(2004).
2011S01489 M00136Bilateral monitoring provides the victim with a GPS enabled device
2011S01489 M00137that will detect the presence of the defendant when he or she enters
2011S01489 M00138a defined radius, warn the victim, and immediately contact law
2011S01489 M00139enforcement. (See, Erez, Ibarra, Lurie, Id. at 16.) Because bilateral
2011S01489 M00140monitoring has been shown to increase the protection offered to
2011S01489 M00141victims of domestic abuse, this legislation includes such a program.
2011S01489 M00142
2011S01489 M00143This legislation will give courts new tools to protect victims of
2011S01489 M00144domestic violence, and will give victims an enhanced manner of
2011S01489 M00145enforcing protective orders, and greater protection from batterers
2011S01489 M00146who violate such orders of protection.

2011S01490 M00004An act
2011S01490 M00005to amend the labor law, in relation to enacting the "paid sick leave
2011S01490 M00006act"
2011S01490 M00007
2011S01490 M00008PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S01490 M00009If enacted, this legislation would require all employers to provide
2011S01490 M00010paid sick leave to employees. Paid sick leave shall accrue at the
2011S01490 M00011rate of one hour for every twenty hours worked by an employee.
2011S01490 M00012Employees may accrue up to eighty hours of paid sick leave and up to
2011S01490 M00013forty hours of paid sick leave for employees of a small business. In
2011S01490 M00014the event of illness or injury, an employee may use paid sick leave
2011S01490 M00015to care for himself or herself, a child, parent, legal guardian or
2011S01490 M00016ward, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, spouse, or other designated
2011S01490 M00017person. Employers shall not seek retribution against employees who
2011S01490 M00018use paid sick leave, and the department has the power to order that
2011S01490 M00019reinstatement, back pay and/or the payment for any paid sick leave be
2011S01490 M00020granted by employers who do seek retribution.
2011S01490 M00021
2011S01490 M00022JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01490 M00023In New York State, a large number of employees do not have paid sick
2011S01490 M00024leave available to them. The problem is most prevalent among
2011S01490 M00025part-time employees working in many different sectors of the state
2011S01490 M00026economy. The problem is greatest among employees toward the lower end
2011S01490 M00027of the economic spectrum, although it is by no means limited to such
2011S01490 M00028employees. This legislation would allow employees to take paid time
2011S01490 M00029off in the event of illness or injury to care for themselves or
2011S01490 M00030others, without fear of retribution from their employer.

2011S01491 M00004An act
2011S01491 M00005to amend the real property tax law, in relation to the assessment of
2011S01491 M00006private forest lands and to provide state assistance to municipal
2011S01491 M00007corporations relating thereto
2011S01491 M00008
2011S01491 M00009PURPOSE:
2011S01491 M00010This bill will provide for full state reimbursement to local taxing
2011S01491 M00011jurisdictions for any tax revenue losses brought about by certain
2011S01491 M00012forest land exemptions.
2011S01491 M00013
2011S01491 M00014SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01491 M00015Provides that the chief executive officer of a municipal corporation
2011S01491 M00016may apply for State aid if the cumulative value of forest lands under
2011S01491 M00017sections 480 and 480-a of the real property tax law is less than its
2011S01491 M00018fully equalized value were section 480 and 480-a not applicable.
2011S01491 M00019
2011S01491 M00020EXISTING LAW:
2011S01491 M00021Sections 480 and 480-a of the real property tax law provide for a
2011S01491 M00022significant reduction in the amount of taxes paid on forested lands.
2011S01491 M00023The law does not, however, provide for full state reimbursement to
2011S01491 M00024local taxing jurisdictions as a result of forest land tax exemptions.
2011S01491 M00025
2011S01491 M00026JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01491 M00027Sections 480 and 480-a of the real property tax law grant exemptions
2011S01491 M00028to certain forest land which decreases the tax base of many towns and
2011S01491 M00029counties in southern New York State, Since the presence of forest
2011S01491 M00030lands benefit the state as a whole, it is only fair and equitable
2011S01491 M00031that any losses of real property revenues incurred by the local
2011S01491 M00032taxing jurisdiction, be reimbursed by the state as a whole.

2011S01492 M00004An act
2011S01492 M00005to amend the town law, in relation to authorizing a town to establish and
2011S01492 M00006operate a town fire department
2011S01492 M00007
2011S01492 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S01492 M00009To allow towns to establish and operate their own fire department, as
2011S01492 M00010a city and village can currently do.
2011S01492 M00011
2011S01492 M00012SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01492 M00013Section 1- Adds a new article 10-A to the town law providing for the
2011S01492 M00014establishment of town fire departments.
2011S01492 M00015
2011S01492 M00016Section 2- Contains the effective date
2011S01492 M00017
2011S01492 M00018EXISTING LAW:
2011S01492 M00019Current law does not allow for the establishment of town fire
2011S01492 M00020departments. However, cities and villages may have fire departments
2011S01492 M00021under their control. A town is only allowed to have a fire protection
2011S01492 M00022district or a fire district with a separate board of commissioners.
2011S01492 M00023
2011S01492 M00024JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01492 M00025As part of the Senate Local Governments Committee report entitled,
2011S01492 M00026"Sharing Services and Saving Tax Dollars," it was discovered that
2011S01492 M00027there is a lot of discrepancy with respect to activities cities,
2011S01492 M00028towns, and villages can provide. One specific example is that cities
2011S01492 M00029and villages can have fire departments, yet towns cannot. While there
2011S01492 M00030may have been some reason for this a hundred years ago when the town
2011S01492 M00031law was created, there no longer exists any reason for this
2011S01492 M00032prohibition.
2011S01492 M00033
2011S01492 M00034This legislation seeks to level the playing field and allow towns to
2011S01492 M00035establish town fire departments.

2011S01493 M00018withdrawals from the account into which such direct deposits are to
2011S01493 M00019be made.

2011S01493 M00021Any language within the agreement that says in any way that
2011S01493 M00022withdrawals by anyone other than the account owner(s) shall be void,
2011S01493 M00023unenforceable and to no effect. Instead, the language will be
2011S01493 M00024understood to mean that any request of withdrawal from anyone other
2011S01493 M00025than the account owners, must be accompanied by at least fifteen (15)
2011S01493 M00026days written notification by the financial institution, to the
2011S01493 M00027account owner(s). Such action would only be permissible when required
2011S01493 M00028by law, or upon receipt of the account owner(s) written permission.

2011S01493 M00030JUSTIFICATION:

2011S01493 M00033a direct deposit service agreement between their employer and their
2011S01493 M00034financial institution. The bill will ensure that withdrawals will not
2011S01493 M00035be made from an employee's account by employers without the
2011S01493 M00036permission of the owner (s) of the account.
2011S01493 M00037
2011S01493 M00038If a situation arises in which there is a dispute between parties, no
2011S01493 M00039money should be taken from the employee's account without notice
2011S01493 M00040given, and the opportunity for due process allowed.

2011S01496 M00028JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01496 M00029There is an increasing public perception around the nation of bias
2011S01496 M00030against minorities in traffic stops. There is much anecdotal evidence
2011S01496 M00031suggesting that this bias exists but little, if any, hard statistics
2011S01496 M00032to prove such a bias. North Carolina has passed legislation requiring
2011S01496 M00033that data be collected on all traffic stops. Connecticut has passed
2011S01496 M00034legislation prohibiting racial profiling as well as requiring data
2011S01496 M00035collection.
2011S01496 M00036Other states are now studying this issue. It is time for New York to
2011S01496 M00037join these states by outlawing racial profiling and by requiring
2011S01496 M00038collection of data on traffic stops. As we enter the 21st Century,
2011S01496 M00039no American should endure a traffic stop because of his or her race
2011S01496 M00040or ethnicity. No driver should fear driving because he or she might
2011S01496 M00041be stopped based only on the color of their skin. New York State
2011S01496 M00042should lead the way in prohibiting this pernicious practice and in
2011S01496 M00043collecting relevant data on the issue.

2011S01498 M00011
2011S01498 M00012SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01498 M00013Section 1- Amends section 8-500 of the election law by adding a new
2011S01498 M00014subdivision 5 to prohibit a person who is a candidate for any public
2011S01498 M00015office to be voted on by the voters of the election district in which
2011S01498 M00016he or she is to serve, or the spouse, parent or child of such
2011S01498 M00017candidate. However, this shall not prohibit a candidate, his or her
2011S01498 M00018spouse, parent, or child from being present at the close of the polls
2011S01498 M00019to receive the results of the election.

2011S01498 M00022
2011S01498 M00023EXISTING LAW:
2011S01498 M00024Section 3-400 of the Election Law prohibits candidates and members
2011S01498 M00025of their family from being election inspectors, however, there is no
2011S01498 M00026such prohibition under section 8-500 for poll watchers.
2011S01498 M00027
2011S01498 M00028JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01498 M00029The Election Law specifically prohibits a candidate for public office
2011S01498 M00030from electioneering within 100 feet of a polling site. In addition,
2011S01498 M00031candidates, their spouses, children or parents are also prohibited
2011S01498 M00032from serving as election inspectors. However, the law governing poll
2011S01498 M00033watchers does not expressly forbid candidates and their family
2011S01498 M00034members from being poll watchers.
2011S01498 M00035
2011S01498 M00036In order to address this ambiguity and to prevent an appearance of
2011S01498 M00037voter intimidation or electioneering, the law should be changed to
2011S01498 M00038prohibit candidates and members of their family from serving as poll
2011S01498 M00039watchers.

2011S01499 M00004CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
2011S01499 M00005proposing an amendment
2011S01499 M00006to section 1 of article 14 of the constitution, in relation to the
2011S01499 M00007management and use of the lands of the state forest preserve
2011S01499 M00008
2011S01499 M00009PURPOSE:
2011S01499 M00010Directs the Department of Environmental Conservation or its successor
2011S01499 M00011agency to establish management areas for newly acquired forest
2011S01499 M00012preserve lands.
2011S01499 M00013
2011S01499 M00014SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01499 M00015Section 1 Amends section 1 of article 14 of the state constitution to
2011S01499 M00016allow for the cutting, sale of and contracting for the sale and
2011S01499 M00017removal of timber on state lands.
2011S01499 M00018
2011S01499 M00019JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01499 M00020In 1885 when the Adirondack Forest Preserve was created by the State,
2011S01499 M00021the intent was to restore the forest that had been recklessly
2011S01499 M00022clear-cut causing detrimental effects to major waterways in New York
2011S01499 M00023including the Hudson River and the Erie Canal. By allowing the state
2011S01499 M00024to sell and/or contract to sell timber removed from the preserve will
2011S01499 M00025not only help with forest management, but also create a source
2011S01499 M00026of revenue for the state that could help fund the management of such
2011S01499 M00027lands.

2011S01553 M00008
2011S01553 M00009PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S01553 M00010
2011S01553 M00011To simplify the application for an absentee ballot in the Education
2011S01553 M00012Law so that the application process is less burdensome and intrusive
2011S01553 M00013on the voter.
2011S01553 M00014
2011S01553 M00015SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01553 M00016
2011S01553 M00017Amends 2018-a of the Education Law, by deleting part of paragraph band
2011S01553 M00018all of paragraph c, and re-numbering paragraphs d, e, and f of
2011S01553 M00019subdivision 2. The absentee ballot application outlined in the
2011S01553 M00020Education Law is thus simplified by eliminating the need for overly
2011S01553 M00021specific and detailed information regarding the voter's absence. Such
2011S01553 M00022information deleted includes:
2011S01553 M00023
2011S01553 M00024* A description of any special circumstances requiring the voter to be
2011S01553 M00025absent.
2011S01553 M00026
2011S01553 M00027* The beginning and end dates of the voter's absence, and
2011S01553 M00028
2011S01553 M00029* The name and address of the voter's employer.
2011S01553 M00030
2011S01553 M00031JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01553 M00032
2011S01553 M00033The Education Law was amended in recent years to require absentee
2011S01553 M00034voting in school district elections and on school budget votes. Now,
2011S01553 M00035school district elections are as open and accessible to the public as
2011S01553 M00036government elections.
2011S01553 M00037
2011S01553 M00038This legislation simplifies the absentee ballot application making it
2011S01553 M00039readable and easy to fill out. Currently, absentee ballot
2011S01553 M00040applications ask for extraneous information about the voter that
2011S01553 M00041could jeopardize his or her safety and privacy. For example,
2011S01553 M00042Education Law specifies that applicants must report the beginning and
2011S01553 M00043end dates they will be on vacation as well as the name of their
2011S01553 M00044employer. Since the application is a public document that anyone has
2011S01553 M00045access to under the Freedom of Information Act, this information
2011S01553 M00046could put a voter, or his or her property, at risk.

2011S01554 M00010PURPOSE:
2011S01554 M00011
2011S01554 M00012The bill provides that every purchaser and seller of residential real
2011S01554 M00013property who attends the closing must be provided by the settlement
2011S01554 M00014agent with voter registration forms, and if a purchaser or seller
2011S01554 M00015does not attend the closing, then the forms shall be provided to the
2011S01554 M00016representative of such purchaser or seller.
2011S01554 M00017
2011S01554 M00018SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01554 M00019
2011S01554 M00020Section 1: Amends the Real Property Law to add a new section 262,
2011S01554 M00021which requires that, at a closing for the sale or purchase of
2011S01554 M00022residential real property, the seller and purchaser shall be provided
2011S01554 M00023with voter registration forms. Subsection one defines a "closing" as
2011S01554 M00024"an in-person meeting to complete final documents incident to the
2011S01554 M00025purchase and sale", and defines "settlement agent" as "the lender in
2011S01554 M00026a non-cash transaction, the title company in a cash transaction and
2011S01554 M00027the managing agent in a cooperative apartment transaction."
2011S01554 M00028Subsection two provides that the forms are to be provided to the
2011S01554 M00029purchaser and seller, except for sellers who are moving out of New
2011S01554 M00030York State. If a purchaser or seller is not present at the closing,
2011S01554 M00031then the forms are to be provided to such person's representative.
2011S01554 M00032Subsection three requires the settlement agent to provide those forms
2011S01554 M00033without cost or charge to the purchaser or seller. Subsection four
2011S01554 M00034directs the county boards of elections to cooperate with settlement
2011S01554 M00035agents to accomplish the purposes of this section.
2011S01554 M00036

2011S01556 M00013to make it easier for citizens to vote and to ensure an orderly and
2011S01556 M00014efficient voting process on election day.
2011S01556 M00015
2011S01556 M00016SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01556 M00017Article 8 of the
2011S01556 M00018election law is
2011S01556 M00019amended to add a new title 6 requiring local boards of elections to
2011S01556 M00020make available to voters the option of casting a paper ballot from
2011S01556 M00021seven days prior to a general, primary or special election up to and
2011S01556 M00022including the day prior to the election. The boards of elections are
2011S01556 M00023given twenty-four hours from the close of the polls to count the
2011S01556 M00024early ballots.
2011S01556 M00025
2011S01556 M00026JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01556 M00027The stress put on state election
2011S01556 M00028systems by high voter
2011S01556 M00029turnout in recent elections highlights the need to streamline the
2011S01556 M00030voting process and avoid a major breakdown that could place an unfair
2011S01556 M00031burden on voters and undermine the public's faith in the electoral
2011S01556 M00032process. Early voting makes participation easier for citizens who
2011S01556 M00033cannot make it to the polls on Election Day because of work, family
2011S01556 M00034obligations or inclement weather, but still provides the security of
2011S01556 M00035requiring voters to personally appear at a designated location to
2011S01556 M00036cast their ballot. Early voting also reduces delays on Election Day
2011S01556 M00037and decreases pressure on local boards of election by spreading out
2011S01556 M00038voting over a period of days.
2011S01556 M00039Thirty-two states currently allow early voting. These states report
2011S01556 M00040few serious problems with early voting and those early voting results
2011S01556 M00041in shorter lines on Election Day. Building an electoral system that
2011S01556 M00042gives every citizen an opportunity to vote is the best way to ensure
2011S01556 M00043fair representation.

2011S01557 M00016
2011S01557 M00017Section 15-120 of the Election Law, subdivisions 1 and 8 as amended by
2011S01557 M00018chapter 373 of the laws of 1978, subdivision 2 as amended by chapter
2011S01557 M00019279 of the laws of 1983, subdivision 3 as amended by chapter 333 of

2011S01557 M00022laws of 1982. A voter of a village may vote as an absentee voter if
2011S01557 M00023he or she is absent for the same reasons as a voter for a general
2011S01557 M00024election. Those reasons would include: duties, occupation, business,
2011S01557 M00025studies, illness, disability, membership in armed forces, patient
2011S01557 M00026status in health facility, inmate in holding or correctional
2011S01557 M00027facility, vacation, or the accompaniment of a spouse, parent, or
2011S01557 M00028child who is an absentee voter.
2011S01557 M00029
2011S01557 M00030JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01557 M00031
2011S01557 M00032Village elections are governed by election laws that differ from
2011S01557 M00033general elections. This has resulted in confusion for those who
2011S01557 M00034administer the village elections, and the village residents who vote.
2011S01557 M00035This legislation would amend village election law for the application
2011S01557 M00036and administration of absentee ballots to conform to those methods
2011S01557 M00037used by other municipalities during primary and general elections. In
2011S01557 M00038the way, both the administrators and voters would use the same
2011S01557 M00039methods to vote by absentee ballot as they would in all other
2011S01557 M00040elections. This legislation would simplify and standardize the
2011S01557 M00041absentee ballot application process so that voting during the village
2011S01557 M00042election would be identical to voting during other elections.

2011S01558 M00004An act
2011S01558 M00005to amend the election law, in relation to failure of new registrants to
2011S01558 M00006enroll
2011S01558 M00007
2011S01558 M00008The bill is designed to remind new registrants who did not enroll in a
2011S01558 M00009party that they will not be able to vote in primary elections and to
2011S01558 M00010afford them a second opportunity to enroll and participate in that
2011S01558 M00011part of the democratic process.
2011S01558 M00012
2011S01558 M00013Section 1: Amends election law section 5-210(9) to add a requirement
2011S01558 M00014that the notice sent by the board of elections to a new registrant
2011S01558 M00015regarding approval or other disposition of his application shall also
2011S01558 M00016inform the registrant that the failure to enroll in a party will
2011S01558 M00017prevent him or her from being able to vote in primary elections. Such
2011S01558 M00018notice is required to be accompanied by a postage paid card addressed
2011S01558 M00019to the board of elections on which the registrant can mark a party
2011S01558 M00020enrollment or decline to be affiliated with one.
2011S01558 M00021
2011S01558 M00022Section 2: Amends election law section 5-302(3) to provide that if a
2011S01558 M00023registrant failed to enroll in a party, but does so on the card
2011S01558 M00024provided with the notice from the board of elections within thirty
2011S01558 M00025after it was sent and at least twenty-five days before a primary
2011S01558 M00026election, then it will not be deemed a change of enrollment and will
2011S01558 M00027be effective when received by the board, thereby enabling the
2011S01558 M00028registrant to vote in the primary.
2011S01558 M00029
2011S01558 M00030Section 3: Provides for the Act to take effect sixty days after it
2011S01558 M00031becomes a law.
2011S01558 M00032
2011S01558 M00033Currently, voters who fail to enroll in a party when they register
2011S01558 M00034cannot participate in primary elections unless they change their
2011S01558 M00035enrollment, which must be done several months or even more than a
2011S01558 M00036year before a primary.
2011S01558 M00037
2011S01558 M00038This bill gives new voters, who may not have been aware of the impact
2011S01558 M00039of their failure to enroll in a party, a second chance to fully
2011S01558 M00040participate in a fundamental part of our democratic process.
2011S01558 M00041It is particularly important because in many areas of the state the
2011S01558 M00042winner of the primary is assured of election.

2011S01559 M00017
2011S01559 M00018Section 1: Amends the Election Law to add a new section 14-105, in
2011S01559 M00019which subdivision one defines an "intermediary" as an individual or
2011S01559 M00020one of several types of organizations that delivers contributions
2011S01559 M00021from another to a candidate or authorized committee, or solicits
2011S01559 M00022contributions to a candidate or authorized committee with the
2011S01559 M00023knowledge of the candidate or his or her authorized committee. Family
2011S01559 M00024members, campaign workers and commercial fundraising firms retained
2011S01559 M00025by the candidate are excluded from this definition.
2011S01559 M00026
2011S01559 M00027Subdivision two requires that when an intermediary delivers
2011S01559 M00028contributions of more than $1000, it must provide the name, mailing
2011S01559 M00029address and occupation of any contributor of over $99, and if the
2011S01559 M00030contribution is two hundred dollars or more, then it must also
2011S01559 M00031provide the name and address of the contributor's employer. The
2011S01559 M00032intermediary is also required to provide the total amount of

2011S01559 M00054Currently, bundlers and other intermediaries, who solicit
2011S01559 M00055contributions on behalf of a candidate, are not subject to disclosure
2011S01559 M00056of the amounts they raise, unlike under Federal law. They also are not
2011S01559 M00057required to report who employs them. Given the high campaign
2011S01559 M00058contribution limits in New York, complete disclosure is all the more
2011S01559 M00059important, as the public should have access to information that might
2011S01559 M00060reveal activities and involvements that lend themselves to attempts
2011S01559 M00061to influence legislation. In 2007, New York received a grade of "C"
2011S01559 M00062from the Campaign Disclosure project because of its campaign finance
2011S01559 M00063disclosure laws.

2011S01560 M00005An act
2011S01560 M00006to amend the real property law, in relation to providing tenants of
2011S01560 M00007residential real property with voter registration forms
2011S01560 M00008
2011S01560 M00009PURPOSE:
2011S01560 M00010
2011S01560 M00011The bill provides that every landlord who rents out residential real
2011S01560 M00012property in New York State shall provide the tenants with voter
2011S01560 M00013registration forms at the time that the fully executed lease is

2011S01560 M00016SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01560 M00017
2011S01560 M00018Section 1: Amends the Real Property Law to add a new section 238-a,
2011S01560 M00019which requires that whenever a tenant rents residential real estate,
2011S01560 M00020at time that the landlord or the landlord's representative provides
2011S01560 M00021the tenant with the lease signed by the landlord, the tenant shall
2011S01560 M00022also be provided with a voter registration form. It also requires the
2011S01560 M00023county boards of elections to make the necessary forms available to
2011S01560 M00024those who rent residential real estate.
2011S01560 M00025
2011S01560 M00026Section 2: Provides for the Act to take effect on the thirtieth day
2011S01560 M00027after it becomes law.

2011S01560 M00031There is no existing law requiring voter registration applications to
2011S01560 M00032be provided by landlords who rent residential real estate.

2011S01560 M00037or out of a county or election district, but may be unaware of this
2011S01560 M00038or of the need to provide a change of address to the local board of
2011S01560 M00039election. This provision provides voters with the opportunity to
2011S01560 M00040register to vote or register a change of address at the time when it
2011S01560 M00041is most likely that they will need to do so in order to secure or

2011S01561 M00012SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01561 M00013Section 1: Amends Election Law subdivision 3 of section 5-210, as
2011S01561 M00014amended by chapter 179 of the laws of 205, to provide that an
2011S01561 M00015application postmarked by no later than fifteen days before the next
2011S01561 M00016primary, general or special election, which is received no later than
2011S01561 M00017ten days before such election, or which is delivered in person at
2011S01561 M00018least 10 days before such election to the county board of elections,
2011S01561 M00019shall entitle such applicant to vote at such election.
2011S01561 M00020
2011S01561 M00021Section 2: Provides for the Act to take effect immediately.
2011S01561 M00022
2011S01561 M00023Under current law, an application postmarked by twenty-five days
2011S01561 M00024before the next primary, general or special election, which is
2011S01561 M00025received at least 20 days before such election, or delivered in
2011S01561 M00026person to the county board of elections at least 10 days before a
2011S01561 M00027special election entitles the applicant to vote in that special
2011S01561 M00028election. It fails to address the right of the applicant to vote in
2011S01561 M00029primary and general elections in the same circumstances, which
2011S01561 M00030appears to be a technical error.

2011S01561 M00032JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01561 M00033Article II, Section 5 of the New York State Constitution requires that
2011S01561 M00034in order to vote in an election a voter's registration must be
2011S01561 M00035completed at least ten days before such election. This bill reduces
2011S01561 M00036the time period prior to an election during which a person can
2011S01561 M00037register to vote and be entitled to vote to the constitutional ten
2011S01561 M00038day minimum, and clarifies that when a registration is received at
2011S01561 M00039least ten days before a primary, general or special election, the
2011S01561 M00040voter is entitled to vote in that election.

2011S01562 M00023eliminate the exemption for judicial candidates from the requirements
2011S01562 M00024of subdivisions 1-3 that in order to petition or run as a candidate
2011S01562 M00025of a party membership the candidate must be a member of that party or
2011S01562 M00026be designated or nominated by a majority of the party committee for
2011S01562 M00027the applicable subdivision. It also creates a new subdivision 5,
2011S01562 M00028which specifically provides that such requirements apply to any
2011S01562 M00029candidate for judicial office in any election where other individuals
2011S01562 M00030can challenge the nomination in a primary election.

2011S01562 M00042Under current law, the exemption from the party membership or
2011S01562 M00043nomination law applicable to candidates for all other offices has
2011S01562 M00044resulted in abuses and a free-for-all in judicial primaries that
2011S01562 M00045confuses the primary electorate. And, the exemption lacks a rational
2011S01562 M00046basis for judicial candidates to be treated differently from
2011S01562 M00047candidates for other public offices in regard to the rules pertaining

2011S01563 M00019qualified person must anticipate being out of the county on the day
2011S01563 M00020of the election or unable to vote in person because

2011S01563 M00025

2011S01563 M00031EXISTING LAW:
2011S01563 M00032
2011S01563 M00033Section 2 of article II of the constitution requires that voters
2011S01563 M00034anticipate that they will be out of the county on election day or
2011S01563 M00035otherwise unable to go to the polls because of illness or physical
2011S01563 M00036disability. No other exceptions are allowed, and over the years the
2011S01563 M00037legislature has grafted onto this restriction additional requirements
2011S01563 M00038for disclosure of the reason the person will be out of the county or
2011S01563 M00039is unable to go to the polls, where the voter will be and the dates
2011S01563 M00040that the voter will be away.
2011S01563 M00041
2011S01563 M00042JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01563 M00043
2011S01563 M00044The restrictions on absentee voting have proved more and more onerous
2011S01563 M00045as we have become a more mobile society, and have also proven to be a
2011S01563 M00046source of much litigation.  The disclosures required by current law
2011S01563 M00047but not the constitution not only violate peoples' privacy rights, but
2011S01563 M00048because absentee ballot requests are a public record, they also pose a
2011S01563 M00049threat to the safety and security of people who are ill or disabled,
2011S01563 M00050as well as to the property of those who will be out of the county.
2011S01563 M00051
2011S01563 M00052The constitution's requirements, as well as those adopted by the
2011S01563 M00053legislature have opened the door widespread and costly litigation in
2011S01563 M00054close and hotly contested races, which place an unnecessary burden on
2011S01563 M00055both candidates and the boards of elections. One of the most recent
2011S01563 M00056examples of this occurred in the recently settled election in the
2011S01563 M0005720th congressional District to replace Kirsten Gillibrand, who was
2011S01563 M00058appointed to fill a Senate vacancy by the governor. In that contest,
2011S01563 M00059Republican candidate Jim Tedesco challenged the absentee ballot cast
2011S01563 M00060by Senator Gillibrand because she might have been in the district on
2011S01563 M00061election day, despite the fact that a voter only needs to have a
2011S01563 M00062reasonable expectation that he or she will be absent from the county
2011S01563 M00063on election day in order to vote my absentee ballot.
2011S01563 M00064
2011S01563 M00065Removal of the constitutional restrictions on voting by absentee
2011S01563 M00066ballot will eliminate such unnecessary wastes of time and money,
2011S01563 M00067prevent the disenfranchisement of qualified voters and encourage
2011S01563 M00068voting by those who might not otherwise go to the polls if it is
2011S01563 M00069inconvenient. It will permit the Legislature to allow qualified
2011S01563 M00070persons to request a paper ballot without requiring an explanation of
2011S01563 M00071the reason for the request, which could be private and personal. It
2011S01563 M00072will also empower the Legislature to consider and determine whether
2011S01563 M00073new technologies may be used for voting at places other than at the
2011S01563 M00074polling place, and whether voting by such means may take place on or
2011S01563 M00075before the date set for an election.

2011S01564 M00020contribute two hundred dollars or more, the statements must disclose
2011S01564 M00021the name and address of the person's employer. In addition, when an
2011S01564 M00022expenditure is made for more than one purpose, or for goods and

2011S01565 M00004An act
2011S01565 M00005to amend the state finance law, in relation to prohibiting political
2011S01565 M00006contributions by businesses that have been awarded state contracts
2011S01565 M00007
2011S01565 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S01565 M00009The purpose of this bill is to ensure that business entities receiving
2011S01565 M00010or renewing state contracts cannot directly or indirectly make
2011S01565 M00011expenditures for political purposes, which could influence their
2011S01565 M00012ability to receive such a contract or renewal, and would in effect
2011S01565 M00013involve the use of public funds to buy such influence.
2011S01565 M00014
2011S01565 M00015SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01565 M00016Section 1: Adds a new state finance law 148, which prohibits state
2011S01565 M00017contractors from making direct and indirect political expenditures in
2011S01565 M00018support of or in opposition to any political organization or candidate.
2011S01565 M00019
2011S01565 M00020Section 2: Provides that the Act shall take effect on the thirtieth
2011S01565 M00021day after it becomes law, and will apply to contracts awarded or
2011S01565 M00022renewed on or after that date.

2011S01565 M00025New bill.
2011S01565 M00026
2011S01565 M00027JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01565 M00028This bill is a response to the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in
2011S01565 M00029Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which effectively
2011S01565 M00030eliminated restrictions on corporations' ability to spend corporate
2011S01565 M00031treasury funds in support of or in opposition to political
2011S01565 M00032candidates, political parties and ballot issues. This decision opens
2011S01565 M00033the floodgates for corporations to use their considerable wealth to
2011S01565 M00034spend as much as they want on independent political advertising in
2011S01565 M00035support of or in opposition to candidates for political office,
2011S01565 M00036ballot issues and political organizations. This could have a
2011S01565 M00037seriously distorting and corrupting effect on the election of our
2011S01565 M00038representatives and the awarding of government contracts, since the
2011S01565 M00039ability to make such expenditures could be used to threaten those
2011S01565 M00040with the authority to award government contracts, as well as
2011S01565 M00041politicians with the power to influence those who award them.

2011S01566 M00010
2011S01566 M00011The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the public is fully
2011S01566 M00012informed of the sources of political advertisements in support of or
2011S01566 M00013in opposition to a candidate, or a ballot proposal or constitutional
2011S01566 M00014amendment, in order to prevent the sponsors of such communications
2011S01566 M00015from concealing their interests in the outcome by acting through
2011S01566 M00016third parties, such as trade associations.
2011S01566 M00017
2011S01566 M00018SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S01566 M00019
2011S01566 M00020Section 1: Adds a new election law section Sec. 14-107, which defines
2011S01566 M00021independent expenditures and those affected by the bill, such as
2011S01566 M00022trade associations, and requires that whenever a person or trade
2011S01566 M00023association makes an independent expenditure of more than one
2011S01566 M00024thousand dollars for a political advertisement or other communication
2011S01566 M00025to the general public, the one paying for it must be identified, and
2011S01566 M00026the communication must state that it is not authorized by the
2011S01566 M00027candidate or his or her committee. If the sponsor is a trade
2011S01566 M00028association, it must disclose its three largest contributors since
2011S01566 M00029January first of the year in which the advertisement is published,
2011S01566 M00030and, if the advertisement is made with respect to a presidential
2011S01566 M00031primary race, it must disclose the three largest contributors since
2011S01566 M00032July first of the year before the primary. Willful violation of these
2011S01566 M00033provisions is punishable by a civil penalty of up to $1,000 or the
2011S01566 M00034cost of the communication, whichever is greater, and the attorney
2011S01566 M00035general is given concurrent jurisdiction with district attorneys to
2011S01566 M00036prosecute such offenses.
2011S01566 M00037
2011S01566 M00038Section 2: Provides that the Act takes effect immediately.

2011S01566 M00044JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01566 M00045
2011S01566 M00046This bill is a response to the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in
2011S01566 M00047Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which effectively
2011S01566 M00048eliminated restrictions on corporations' ability to spend corporate
2011S01566 M00049treasury funds in support of or in opposition to political
2011S01566 M00050candidates, political parties and ballot issues. Disclosure of
2011S01566 M00051corporate funding of political advertising is viewed by many as at
2011S01566 M00052
2011S01566 M00053least a partial solution, as it will empower the press to investigate
2011S01566 M00054the interests being served by
2011S01566 M00055the political advertising, and allow the public to make informed
2011S01566 M00056decisions regarding the weight to be given to such advertising.
2011S01566 M00057Because recent statements by some corporate leaders have indicated
2011S01566 M00058that they would try to hide their political expenditures by
2011S01566 M00059contributing to trade associations that could buy political
2011S01566 M00060advertisements without disclosing the source of their funding, this
2011S01566 M00061bill requires that such trade associations disclose in any such
2011S01566 M00062advertisements their three largest contributors.

2011S01567 M00017SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01567 M00018
2011S01567 M00019Section 1 -- Establishes that there shall be a space on voter
2011S01567 M00020registration cards for a person to provide their e-mail address. The
2011S01567 M00021person registering to vote is not required to provide an e-mail
2011S01567 M00022address, and the voter registration form will notify voters that if
2011S01567 M00023an e-mail address is provided, all official communications from the
2011S01567 M00024New York State Board of Elections will be sent to that person's
2011S01567 M00025regular mail address and e-mail address.
2011S01567 M00026
2011S01567 M00027Additionally, section one permits voters who use the federal voter
2011S01567 M00028registration form to provide their e-mail address when registering to
2011S01567 M00029vote.
2011S01567 M00030
2011S01567 M00031Section 2 -- Establishes that, for people providing their e-mail
2011S01567 M00032addresses when registering to vote, the person's e-mail address will
2011S01567 M00033appear on the registration poll records.

2011S01567 M00037JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01567 M00038
2011S01567 M00039Many people now rely on their e-mail as much as their postal mail to
2011S01567 M00040stay connected to the world. By providing an optional entry for
2011S01567 M00041e-mail addresses on voter registration forms, boards of elections
2011S01567 M00042will be able to reach voters via e-mail with all pertinent election
2011S01567 M00043information.
2011S01567 M00044Currently, those registering to vote in New York State do not have the
2011S01567 M00045ability to provide their e-mail addresses to the Board of Elections,
