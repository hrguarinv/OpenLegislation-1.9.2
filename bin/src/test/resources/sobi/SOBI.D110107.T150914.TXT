2011A01088 T00072   17  been  adequately  maintained and have not reached their projected useful

2011A01088 T00077   22  protect  the health and safety of students or staff, that reconstruction
2011A01088 T00078   23  and modernization of the existing building would not adequately  address

2011A01088 T00080   25  ing  was  not  caused by failure to adequately maintain the building. If
2011A01088 T00081   26  the commissioner of labor resets the statewide index reflecting  changes
2011A01088 T00082   27  in  the  costs of labor and materials since July first, nineteen hundred
