2011A04956 T00057    3  by providing that any agreement between the parties be given retroactive
2011A04956 T00058    4  effect  to the date on which the unfair labor practice was found to have
2011A04956 T00059    5  commenced and by providing for  appropriate  interest  from  that  date,
2011A04956 T00060    6  calculated  using  the  short-term  federal rate for the underpayment of
2011A04956 T00061    7  taxes as set out in 26 U.S.C. 6621.14, except that the make whole relief
2011A04956 T00062    8  provided for under this paragraph shall not be ordered when and  to  the

2011A04956 T00064   10  bargain in good faith. When the board has determined that a duly  recog-
2011A04956 T00065   11  nized  or  certified employee organization representing public employees
2011A04956 T00066   12  has breached its duty of fair representation in the processing or  fail-
2011A04956 T00067   13  ure  to process a claim alleging that a public employer has breached its
2011A04956 T00068   14  agreement with such employee organization,  the  board  may  direct  the
2011A04956 T00069   15  employee  organization  and  the public employer to process the contract
2011A04956 T00070   16  claim in accordance with the parties' grievance procedure.    The  board
2011A04956 T00071   17  may,  in  its  discretion, retain jurisdiction to apportion between such
2011A04956 T00072   18  employee organization and public employer  any  damages  assessed  as  a
2011A04956 T00073   19  result  of  such  grievance procedure. The pendency of proceedings under
2011A04956 T00074   20  this paragraph shall not be used as the basis to delay or interfere with
2011A04956 T00075   21  determination of representation status pursuant to section  two  hundred
2011A04956 T00076   22  seven  of  this article or with collective negotiations. The board shall
2011A04956 T00077   23  exercise exclusive nondelegable jurisdiction of the powers granted to it
2011A04956 T00078   24  by this paragraph, in which  connection,  no  finding  of  fact  or  law
2011A04956 T00079   25  contained  in a report and recommendation of a hearing officer appointed
2011A04956 T00080   26  pursuant to subdivision two of  section  seventy-five  of  this  chapter
2011A04956 T00081   27  shall  preclude  the  resolution of any issue of fact or law in a subse-
2011A04956 T00082   28  quent proceeding held under procedures established by  the  board  under
2011A04956 T00083   29  this paragraph; provided, however, that this sentence shall not apply to
2011A04956 T00084   30  the  city of New York. The board of collective bargaining established by
2011A04956 T00085   31  section eleven hundred seventy-one of the New York  city  charter  shall
2011A04956 T00086   32  establish procedures for the prevention of improper employer and employ-
2011A04956 T00087   33  ee  organization practices as provided in section 12-306 of the adminis-
2011A04956 T00088   34  trative code of the city of New York, provided, however,  that  a  party
2011A04956 T00089   35  aggrieved  by a final order issued by the board of collective bargaining
2011A04956 T00090   36  in an improper practice proceeding may, within ten days after service of
2011A04956 T00091   37  the final order, petition the board for review thereof.   Within  twenty
2011A04956 T00092   38  days  thereafter,  the board, in its discretion, may assert jurisdiction
2011A04956 T00093   39  to review such final order. The failure  or  refusal  of  the  board  to
2011A04956 T00094   40  assert  jurisdiction  shall not be subject to judicial review.  Upon the
2011A04956 T00095   41  refusal of the board to assert jurisdiction, an  aggrieved  party  shall
2011A04956 T00096   42  have the right to seek review of the final order of the board of collec-
2011A04956 T00097   43  tive bargaining. Such proceeding to review shall be brought within thir-
2011A04956 T00098   44  ty  days  of  the  board's  refusal  and  shall otherwise conform to the
2011A04956 T00099   45  requirements of article seventy-eight of  the  civil  practice  law  and

2011A04956 T00101   47  whole  or  in  part, or modify the final order, or remand the matter for
2011A04956 T00102   48  further proceedings, or make such other order as it may  deem  appropri-

2011A04956 T00105   51  regarding testimony of witnesses shall be final and not subject to board
